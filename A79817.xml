            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">F</seg>Inding my ſelf unable to maſter the trouble and alteration wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with I was ſurpriſd upon the loſs of two Friends about <hi>Chriſtmas</hi> laſt, whom I had reaſon to eſteem, and ſeverall other affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions that came upon me all at once; I took the advice after a few days diſquiet to divert my thoughts by ſom unuſuall emploiment, which might turn the ſtream &amp; not choak up the ſource, giving work enough to entertain my mind &amp; not tire it, being both ſubſtantiall and yet an eaſy exerciſe. Walking therfor all alone in your garden I fell into re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance
<pb facs="tcp:170217:3"/>of this preſent ſubject, wch liked me well becaus my head was full of the ſtory and paſſages therof; that it would prove eaſy to me on that account to write it, and yet being unaccuſtomed to make books (this being the firſt) I ſhould be ſufficiently taken up therby, if not in the inventing of matter yet at leaſt in the ordering of words to the excluſion of unprofitable paſſion wch would otherwiſe creep in and to much annoy my mind.</p>
            <p>The conceit has proovd right. For at two months end, wherin my mind as buſy as any Bee was wholly taken up in inventing contriving writing and reviewing theſe Dialogs, by that time I had fully finiſhed them, I perceivd my paſſion wholly allayd and my ſpirit in its wonted temper. And now I ſee clearly and do pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blikly proclaim that every paſſion is in the comand of reaſon, and that
<pb facs="tcp:170217:3"/>induſtry both prevents ſin and ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dues ſorrow.</p>
            <p>The whole work conſiſts of three parts wherin nine arguments ar hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, in each part three. Tis diſputed.
<list>
                  <item>I. <hi>Whether innovation of Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an doctrin may be made by man, or hath ever been made by the Papiſt.</hi>
                  </item>
                  <item>II. <hi>Whether it be prudence to caſt away our explicit articles of beleef and betake our ſelvs to the Bible for our faith: and whether hearing and prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching of the Word of God be the capi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall and eſſentiall work of Chriſtian religion.</hi>
                  </item>
                  <item>III. <hi>Whether the church may for the quiet of ſome perſon or nation comply wth opinions ſhe would other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wis diſlike of: and wt opinions have happed at times contrary to po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pery.</hi>
                  </item>
                  <item>IV. <hi>Whether it be ſufficient to ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation onely to beleev in Chriſt as the unum neceſſarium.</hi>
                  </item>
                  <pb facs="tcp:170217:4"/>
                  <item>V. <hi>Whether the articles propoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded in the oath of abjuration, as the popes ſupremacy, real preſence, purga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory, worſhip of ſaints, and merit of good works, be plauſible doctrin.</hi>
                  </item>
                  <item>VI. <hi>Whether the ſaid oath may be honeſtly taken by any man upon earth Chriſtian Iew or pagan: whether in al &amp; every controverſy of religion there may be given one generall rule againſt wch no ſectary can except that ſhall notwthſtanding conclude infallibly for the Catholik, wthout turning a leaf of Scriptur, councells or fathers: and wt may be the grounds can retard a papiſt from reformation.</hi>
                  </item>
                  <item>VII. <hi>Whether the Apostls and Evangeliſts wer all papiſts, that is to ſay ſuch Catholiks as be at this day.</hi>
                  </item>
                  <item>VIII. <hi>Whether any one text of Scriptur may juſtly be brought out of the old or new Teſtament againſt the Catholik church, or any one article of her faith:</hi> and <hi>whether reaſon may
<pb facs="tcp:170217:4"/>poſſibly frame an argument to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince a papiſt, or remove him from the rock wheron he is ſeated.</hi>
                  </item>
                  <item>IX. <hi>Whether each particular opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion or poſitiv article of popery re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected by the reformation will not ſeem to right reaſon indifferently ſtated, if it allow of any religion at all, more ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionall and pious than the contrary negativ.</hi>
                  </item>
               </list>
            </p>
            <p>Theſe be the principal things di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſputed in my nine conferences; wch be ſo ordered that they have not dependence or connexion one wth another, but each ſeveral Dialogue is a book by it ſelf.</p>
            <p>Some doctours have thought that the ſacred Dialogues called the book of <hi>Job</hi> are Hiſtorically true for the ground and ſubject of the Diſcours; as that ther was ſuch a perſon as <hi>Iob;</hi> brought into ſuch a dejected condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; ſet upon and checkt by three neighbour Diſputants there named,
<pb facs="tcp:170217:5"/>and the like. But the words and te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour of their ſpeech this they think was ordered by the ſacred Penman according the property of the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons proportionable to his own drift and purpos, not ſo much heeding to ſet down word for word what they did ſay as what they might ſay.</p>
            <p>The ſame is to be thought of theſe Dialogs; for the ground and occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of them is reall Hiſtory. A pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſt Knight offering love to a Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant Lady could not have audience but under condition of changing his religion For that purpos ſhe brought him a Divine accompanied wth his wife a witty woman to confer wth him, and by their help reclaimd him. But my Vicares was you may think more pregnant in her gnomeys texts and doxes, than I have ſuffered her to be in this literall accoaſt, wherin ſhe ſtands like a ſaltſellar at a ban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quet, only for a grain or two of ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoning:
<pb facs="tcp:170217:5"/>for I was loth to have my book overſwoln wth her witty va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity. I was ſomwhile in doubt whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther I ſhould let her com in at all or no; but becaus in the laſt Dialog ſhe alone wth the <hi>Lady</hi> in the <hi>Miniſters</hi> abſence reclaimd the <hi>Knight</hi> I had too much prevaricated from the truth of my ſtory &amp; wrongd her ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour if I had quite left her out. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides ſith the Miniſter &amp; his wife wer <hi>commilitores</hi> in this imployment, I could not well ſeparat whom not onely the <hi>common wealth</hi> but even their <hi>common warfar</hi> had united.

                  <l>Deinde thorus junxit, tandem ipſa periculajungunt.</l>

            </p>
            <p>The work being ended (ſo much as I mean to put forth at this time) comes running voluntary and of its own natur, as you ſee S<hi rend="sup">r</hi> unto your friendly hands; wher it doubts not but to find a favourable entertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment both by the candour of your own natur, and your particular good will to the Authour ſeverall wayes expreſt. If it be ſo happy as to give you content, I ſhall applaud the evill that occaſiond me ſo much good; as indeed all croſſes of this life if they be well managed do operat unto fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther good and benefit than would have happed wthout them. It will be to me a double comfort by theſe few exercitations both to have over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>com
<pb facs="tcp:170217:7"/>my own trouble; and alſo to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertain a friend I do ſo highly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect.</p>
            <p>Your many civilitys and much kindnes towards me clayms a right in all my thoughts and actions, and therfor indeed when they be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented to you they com not as offe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rings of worth but of duty; though I ſhould my ſelf take moſt pleaſur in duty that is ſerviceable. Altho S<hi rend="sup">r</hi> I had not a motiv of obligation, the great temperance and moderation I have obſerved in you, ſuch as I have ſeldom ſeen in young Gentlmen of your age, your retired diſpoſition &amp; ſelf ſufficiency to live contentedly in your own breaſt, whilſt others wth much expens of time ſeck themſelvs abroad, would hav invited me to the boldnes of this addres: for books love to be preſented to the hands of ſuch as will peruſe them.</p>
            <p>Wch way ſoever your inclination
<pb facs="tcp:170217:8"/>bends in matter of Religion, either my Knights diſcours will anſwer to it, or at leaſt the reaſonings of his three opponents againſt him; either his valour in the defence of his Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion or his fall from it.</p>
            <p>Three things I have mainly aimed at in theſe conferences; that they ſhould be uſeful, familiar and new. Uſefull and beneficiall both by the choiſe of a grave and weighty ſubject ſuch as is Religion and vertue, &amp; alſo by a rational vindication &amp; defence therof: Familiar and eaſy, both by an ordinary form of words, natural and proper to the language wherin they be written, and by the eaſy flowing ſtrain wthout any logical collection of ſyllogiſm or citation of authours &amp; autority of Latin ſentences: Unu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuall and new, both by handling ſuch things as have not yet (at leaſt for aught I know) been treated of; &amp; by abſtaining both from all common
<pb facs="tcp:170217:8"/>places &amp; heads of controverſys, well have been already over and over and more than enough diſcust, and alſo from the ordinary way of handling them if they do chance (as in the fift Dialog they do) to light in my way. For we find that a crambical repeti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the ſame things brings a nauſcouſnes upon men how impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant ſoever the things in themſelvs may be; peopl alſo are now run into new ways of errour, and ther for new ways muſt be thought on to reduce them.</p>
            <p>This purpos of mine, I am ſure is good; but God knows how far I have hit it. Wher any man that is my friend perceivs me to fail, let him not ſpend time in vain to chide and cenſur me but help me, for his help<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing hand I do humbly crave of him; if he be an enemy let him uſe his diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretion.</p>
            <p>If I find theſe three Dialogues

               <p>The multiform grace and induſtry of ſeverall reformers raiſed by the Lord have brought things to light wch wer hidden in former ages.

I need not travell far to ſhow you this. Our Engliſh writers from <hi>Harry</hi> the eight unto this preſent day will make it ſufficiently mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt unto you if you could peruſe them, how that ſtill the ſucceeding Doctours added ever new degrees of light to the diſcoverys of forgoing divines. Parlaments in the ſam manner did not all at once remov ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtition out of the land, but perfected the work of reformation by degrees, wch is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed a progres moſt conformable both to to natur and art. <hi>Room</hi> was not built in a day, nor will it in one day be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyd.

               <p>I ſee and acknowledg that new refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mations in Religion are daily made; but whether to the edification or ruin thereof dos not yet ſo clearly appear. A continuall taking away is an odd kind of mending: nor do I know any thing in natur made better or greater therby ſave only a gap. The pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended lights that have riſen from time to time one after another I have hitherto ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken to be meer unwholſom exhalations, ſulphureous meteors, or ſom <hi>ignes fatui</hi> good for nothing but to lead men into lakes and ditches.</p>
            </sp>
            <p>The daily riſing of new opinions in Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion maks me rather ſuſpect all than ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prov of any innovation; becaus thes opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions ar all of them but new denialls of ſom part of the ancient Catholik-faith wch former reformers had not yet at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained the confidence to reject: ſo that it is ſtil but the ſame kind of audacity &amp; the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry ſelf ſame preſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="3 letters">

<pb n="6" facs="tcp:170217:13"/>ſom new degree of daring. And ther was never any harlot that caſt of all her cloths at once, but according as ſhe grew by degrees more ſhamleſs. They that threw down the altar left a tabl ſtanding in the Church, and the firſt vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latours of picturs did not break al the glaſs windows, yet their ſucceſlours hav finiſht the work, and the bare walls now ſtanding ar dangerouſly threatnd. In the ſame man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner be articls of faith defaced and raſed in the hearts and ſpirits of men by a graduall proceeding of infidelity and hereſy ſtill in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſing in its growth of imodeſty, til of the whol fabrick of Chriſtian religion ther be not left one ſton upon another; wch is the way not of compoſition but ſolution, it dos not renew but impair.</p>
            <p>I ſhould look ſtrangely upon that Phe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition who will firſt make me beleeve I am ſick when I do not find in my ſelf that I ill any thing or complain at all; and then taking upon him even againſt my will to reform me in my health, purges me too &amp; again till I bee not able to ſtand on my legs, drawing ſtill from me till my body be quit conſumed, and never adding any poſitiv thing to ſuſtain me. Or if he ſhould
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:170217:13"/>begin on the outſid, and firſt tear of my cloths, then my skin, and ſo my fleſh, and bones, ſtill telling me it is for the renewing of my health and cheerfulnes, I could not judg this other than outragious mockery, and moſt cruell inhuman abuſe. Yet ſuch and no other be all reformations in religion; a continuall cancelling of doctrins formerly receivd and practiſed, a daily ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king away without addition of any thing, and that in deſpight of the Church whos doctrine it is. This is one reaſon I like not to hear of thes reformations much les to behold wth mine eyes the wofull ruins and diſorders accompany them both in Church and ſtate.</p>
            <p>Another is, I cannot ſee when there will be any end therof, the ſucceſſours ſtill pretending the unlimited right of innova<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion the unlimited right of innova<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion left them as hereditary by their fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, wch right for aught I ſee all genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions ar equally ambitious to put in pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctis; ſo that nothing is ſtabl or ſecure, no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing at all unchangeable; nor can any one tell either what faith he livs in, or in what he is to dy. Indeed ſuch men as would not be containd in their bounds by a profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of infallibillity wch they had in the
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:170217:14"/>Church, how ſhall a profeſſion of fallibili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty exhibited by hereſy contain them! a fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lible liberty and a free fallibility can never lin rolling; nor will they ever reſt ſtated, till they be faln into the gulf of atheiſm.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>Madam,</hi> thes ſeverall new ways of hereſy argue firſt, that the ring-leaders and followers of the Lutheran faction the moſt dangerous epidemicall revolt I think hath ever happed ſince the Apoſtles days did not forſak the church for any reaſon they had ſo to do, but firſt forſook the church and then ſought out a reaſon to colour their revolt. For had they had any one or many reaſons for their diviſion, thes being once cleard and anſwered by the Catholick church, ſo far that they could no longer inſiſt upon their ſcattered principls, they would hav returnd unanimouſly unto that body whence they and their for-fathers had impiouſly apoſtatiſd; and not have ſtudied other ſhifts as vain as the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer and perhaps more wicked too, wherby to maintain themſelvs and adherents in the wretched Schiſm whereunto they had formerly run purly indeed upon ſenſuall and carnall motivs, whatſoever themſelves pretend.</p>
            </sp>
            <p>Secondly thes new ways and daily altera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of ſectarys do ſufficiently demonſtrat
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:170217:15"/>that out of the Catholick church ther is not that unity consent and ſtablnes wch may mov a prudent man to beleev that ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther all thoſe Sects together, or any one of them ar that myſticall body of Chriſt that keeps an unity of ſpirit in the bond of peace. Eph. 4.2. and wch is fitly joind and compact together; <hi>v.</hi> 16. ſith they nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther agree together in the articles of their heleef, nor yet in the motivs of their apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtaſy from that church that is and ever hath been ſo united and compacted in it ſelf; nor have in themſelves any ſtability or conſiſtency at all. That is not grounded which never lins moving.</p>
            <p>Again, thes new ways of oppugning the church are not onely new declarations of former negativs maintaind by their for-fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers againſt the church, but additions of new negativs and further apoſtaſie: wch infers as much diviſion from their prede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſors, as they had from the firſt faith of the church; and ſo they give me no ſecurity at all of adhering unto any, ſith I may ſtill in prudence doubt of any, even the laſt ſeparation, whether that be the unſpotted ſpous of Chriſt or a new purification yet to be expected. And who can aſſure me that
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:170217:15"/>any ſuch thing ſhall happen in my life time to be made uſe of by me, or that I ſhall ever ſee that glorious church not having ſpot or wrinkl or any ſuch thing, holy and wth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hout blemiſh, <hi>Eph.</hi> 5.27. unto wch I may incorporat my ſelf. For the laſt ſeparation ſtill exclaimes againſt' the former, as they did againſt the mother church, and that wch is to come will do the like againſt this.</p>
            <p>Beſides, theſe ſeveral new ways if they be well examined appear ſo to daſh one againſt another, that altho all of them ſtrike expreſſy at the mother church, yet they wound her through one anothers ſides; and if any ſhould beleev them he ſhall not poſſibly find any thing to adher unto, unles he blindly cloſe wth the firſt he meets and condemn all others wth the ſam folly he made chois of this.</p>
            <p>Our later Writers here in <hi>England,</hi> L. <hi>Faukland, Chillingworth</hi> and others, driv if I miſtake not againſt Religion in generall, and ſtrike as much at any or all as at the Catholick. The Socinians they have ſprung a mine under the church ſo deep and dangerous, that it makes the very battle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of heaven to ſhake, at leaſt in the
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:170217:16"/>eyes of man; openly and wthout diſſimula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion oppugning the very divinity of the Son of God, &amp; crucifying not ſo much the lord of glory, as the very lordſhip and glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of that lord, finally calling many things in queſtion wch former heretiks left un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toucht. And now one may meet here in e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very town &amp; villag wth ſom or other blaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheming openly againſt the whol Goſpell of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> ſuch as hear them laughing at the conceit without any ſens at all or zeal of Gods glory and their own finall hopes. This is the fruit of thes new ways freſh wits and daily inventions, wherby the utter de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolation is day by day conſummated. <hi>Nemo repente fuit turpiſſimus,</hi> no man on the ſodain was ever made ſtark naught; and be degrees doth every <hi>hereſy</hi> how ſlight ſoever it be in the beginning, ſink it ſelf in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenſibly into atheiſm, containing moſt of <hi>Catholick</hi> faith in the firſt and imediat ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration, till by degrees it all expire. This is the perfection Religion gets by the addi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of new wits and the progres of inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation.</p>
            <p>The knowledg and experience of theſe miſchiefs makes the Catholik church wch is the wiſeſt congregation hath ever been or
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:170217:16"/>poſſibly ever can bee upon earth, to curb and ſtifl every wtſoever <hi>innovation</hi> as far as lies in her power at its firſt upriſing how ſmall ſoever it be, knowing full well that from ſuch a littl egg is by littl and littl formd a dangerous adder, and this in time wingd into a flying ſerpent.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>KNIGT.</speaker>
               <p>By your favour, you ar much miſtaken your ſelf in your ſimilitud, or would at leaſt beguil me. If religion wer a <hi>human</hi> invention the conſequence were good. For all inventions of <hi>man</hi> iſſuing from an imperfect principl, by the applica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of freſh hands and underſtandings ſuperadded to the former, as new degrees of perfection in the principle, do receiv in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creas, and the arts ar then com to the height when they have paſt through ſo many hands and heads as be able to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>print ſo much perfection as the ſubject or matter is capable to receiv. So that all thoſe heads and hands put together, as well that perfected as that firſt invented the ſcience, do but make up one complet perfect principle of the art or invention
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:170217:17"/>reſulting thence, wch receives perfection proportionabl to the gradual acces of its original from whence it flows, and ſtill as natur and induſtry perfects that, ſo does the art increaſe. Thus much I can grant. And if Religion were an human invention, the very ſame affection would be found in it alſo. Tis here to be noted that we do not treat of Theology or ſcholaſticall learning, wch is a ſcience ſuperadded to the primary principles of Religion; for this I ſhal grant to be humane as Phyſick or the civill law is, if it be taken preciſely according to its concluſions and inferences without reſpect had to the principles whence it flowes, and it may alter in its manner and method as they do. But I ſpeak purely of thoſe pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mary principles whereupon this Theology is founded, for theſe only are faith, and the unalterable doctrine of the Chriſtian church.</p>
            </sp>
            <p>This Religion and Faith deliverd unto us by God if the Goſpell and Scripturs be true, differs as to our preſent purpoſe in two points from all other humane ſciences. Firſt, that it iſſued at firſt from a principle abſolutly complet, ſecondly that ther is not upon earth any principl already exiſting or
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:170217:17"/>poſſible to exiſt that can join wth that principl to add to the perfection of the work.</p>
            <p>God who reveald and taught this faith is an infinit intellect and an underſtanding infinitly actuated, of ſuch exceſſive perfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction that it may eaſlier be admird and worſhipt than expreſt. And therfor the faith that iſſued from him muſt have its whol perfection at the firſt impreſſion, and that infinit degrees more abſolut than arts and ſciences receive at the laſt; that coms forth abſolutly pure and perfect, thes re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv their perfection ſuch as it is in their progres. The further Religion proceeds from its firſt inſtitution or revelation, the more tis ſullied by the comerce of man, whos practis by deviating from its dictats fouls it as it were by contagion of the veſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſell: but if he ſhall once dare to enterpoſe the reſults of his own judgment wth thoſe revealed articles, to deny any or add to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, mingling his own urin with that ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naturall current, then does the water of life run troubled, muddy and corrupted, and ceaſes to be divine; nor is ther any way to rectify it, but by having recourſe to its firſt pure ſours and according to that ſamplar
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:170217:18"/>to clarify it again. But <hi>human</hi> inventions ariſing at the firſt unpoliſht and rough, if their <hi>perfection</hi> be to be meaſurd are not called back to their firſt <hi>originall,</hi> but exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mind rather by the nearnes to the laſt and final <hi>experiment.</hi> This is the firſt diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence as concerning our purpos in hand betwixt <hi>divine</hi> faith and <hi>human</hi> ſciences, Religion and arts, <hi>gods</hi> worſhip and <hi>mans</hi> works.</p>
            <p>The other is, that ther is not upon earth any other <hi>principl</hi> which may add any thing to <hi>Religions</hi> perfection, renew or al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter it in any kind.</p>
            <p>Arts, ſciences, garbs, languages and fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhions of <hi>men,</hi> thes do expect their perfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction from <hi>mans</hi> induſtry whence they had their firſt being: and <hi>humane</hi> induſtry and wit preſumes rightfully to make ſeverall additions, alterations and <hi>changes</hi> in them according to the variety that is in mens fanſies. Theſe <hi>alterations</hi> be either per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections or at leaſt ſo eſteemd by <hi>men</hi> who introduce and receiv them, which is all one in human ſociety; for amongſt men that is the <hi>beſt</hi> wch is in uſe and <hi>faſhion</hi> as may be ſeen in languages garbs and faſhions of attire wch <hi>chang</hi> continually &amp; ſtil for the
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:170217:18"/>beſt at leaſt in vulgar opinion, till the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhions do inſenſibly wear out one another, and that return again by degrees wch afor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time was rejected, rendring that <hi>faſhion</hi> contemptible by wch it ſelf had been in former times made vile. Thus mans thoughts and al the <hi>works</hi> of his hands run inceſſantly in a circular <hi>motion</hi> wearing out one another wth a ſtrang reſtleſneſs con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veyed into things from the inſtability of <hi>fanſy</hi> their firſt contriver, wch can never ſtay, or remain in the fame ſtate, but likes and diſlikes, creats and deſtroyes, does and undoes continually, and ſeems to be pleaſd wth nothing but <hi>variety.</hi> And ſo all <hi>hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi> workma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſhips of whatſoever kind they be, do meet with ſeverall fanſies of <hi>men</hi> un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to all wch they are equally ſubject, and apt at pleaſur by them to be contrould alterd varied and ſubdud according tot he diver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity of imaginations they meet withall.</p>
            <p>All this is apparently tru, and lively ſet out by <hi>Salomon</hi> in his Ecceleſiaſtes, where he affirms that ther <hi>is nothing new under the Sun</hi> and that ther <hi>is a ſeaſon for every thing and a time for very purpos under heaven, a tim to break down and a tim to build, a tim to rent and a time to ſoe?</hi> As if he ſhould have
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:170217:19"/>ſaid, man now <hi>fanſyes</hi> one thing, and then is pleaſd wth the <hi>contrary,</hi> now heel plant an <hi>orchard</hi> &amp; then heel turn it into a <hi>mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow,</hi> now he will build a hous in one <hi>faſhion</hi> and then alter it into another, and the like; ſo that all his works <hi>chang</hi> and run in a circl, till his former rejected fanſy perhaps return again, and ſeem to be ſom <hi>new</hi> buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes but indeed it is not: for all that is now brought up has been afortime rejected, as that wch is now refuſed hath been liked of and will be ſo again; ſo that under the Sun is <hi>nihil novi</hi> no new thing; either in lawes, ſtates, governments, buildings, books, fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhions languages or other thing invented or contrivd by man. The very dyet and company wch ſeven years ago diſpleaſd us hath now loſt its taſt. Finally al that one ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> 
               <hi>does</hi> either himſelf or ſom other like himſelf will <hi>undo</hi> it again, and mould it in another faſhion, the works of man being totally ſubject to his <hi>humour,</hi> and not iſſuing at firſt from any ſelf-ſufficient, ſelf-ſingular, ſelf-eternall uncontroulable intellect, are apt indifferently to follow the guidance of any thing that pertaks of that <hi>reaſon</hi> wch gave them their firſt being.</p>
            <pb n="19" facs="tcp:170217:19"/>
            <p>But <hi>religion</hi> is not thus ſubject to the underſtanding or fancy of any one <hi>man</hi> or all men together. For mans <hi>underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi> and gods do not agree together in the ſame <hi>reaſon</hi> as two individualls in one ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies, and conſequently wt is dictated by the one that is infinitely perfect, ſelf-ſingular and incomunicable, cannot be contrould by the other wch is infinitely imperfect common and accidentally ſingulariſd. A thing is naturally ſubject to his own <hi>caus</hi> or ſome thing at leaſt unto wch that <hi>prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipl</hi> it ſelf is ſubject and nothing els; the works and will of <hi>man</hi> to man, the works, and will of <hi>God</hi> to god, the thoughts and actions of man both to man and God alſo to whom man himſelf is ſubject, but the word and will of <hi>God</hi> are ſo his, that they can not be in mans power who is a poor <hi>vaſſail</hi> both to God and his will and word too. What <hi>man</hi> hath once willed, not onely <hi>God</hi> but <hi>man</hi> alſo may fruſtrat it by willing the contrary; but he cannot alter the will of <hi>God</hi> nor deſtroy any of his <hi>works:</hi> Towns he can overthrow, and Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cards and Gardens wch himſelf hath planted; but where is the <hi>man</hi> can pull a ſtar out of heaven, annihilat one of the ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:170217:20"/>or add another to thoſe wch <hi>God</hi> hath made.</p>
            <p>In all reaſon I think it is apparent to every one that the will and <hi>Word</hi> of the <hi>Allmighty</hi> cannot be ſubjected to ſuch a poore pittifull thing as <hi>man</hi> is: he muſt be led by it and not draw it to his pleaſure, by adding or diminiſhing, by chopping and changing as he liſts. Wherfore our B. <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour,</hi> when ſom upon the doctrin they had heard him deliver, doubted and askt him wth a <hi>quomodo,</hi> how <hi>can man forgive ſins:</hi> and again others, <hi>how can he give us his fleſh to eat:</hi> It is very obſervable that our Lord never went about to ſatisfy their curioſity or declar to them <hi>how</hi> or in what manner it might be don, it being indeed below the Majeſty of <hi>God</hi> to give his vaſſail a <hi>reaſon</hi> of his will: but he ſingly repeated again his owne aſſertion wthout ſhowing the provability or poſſibility thereof; ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by giving us to underſtand that the inſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions and will of <hi>God</hi> ar not to be ſubjected to the <hi>underſtanding</hi> or man to be admitted or rejected according to that probability they ſhall carry in it, but humbly to be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted wth all ſubmiſſion and lowlines, as the <hi>will</hi> of that in finit ſuprem power unto
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:170217:20"/>wch mans underſtanding and the whol <hi>creation</hi> is ſubjected. And therefore good S. <hi>Paul</hi> willed that <hi>every intellect ſhould be captivated to the obedience of Chriſt,</hi> 2. <hi>Cor.</hi> 10.5. that is to ſay, ſubject to the dicta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mens of his faith and Religion as a <hi>captive</hi> ſlave to the will of his <hi>maiſter;</hi> And conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently as a ſlave cannot controul his maiſter, ſo neither hath mans reaſon any right or power at all to chang or alter add or diminiſh from Gods revealed will; holy ſcripture denounceing therfor <hi>anathema</hi> to ſuch as ſhould dare to do it againſt their duty and allegiance.</p>
            <p>All this being aſſuredly true, ther can be no place in <hi>religion</hi> for <hi>new</hi> ways of fresher wits, for innovations, reformations, clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, clenſings, additions, ſubtractions and other ſuch like mouldings and workings upon it, as there is in arts and ſciences and other ſuch like <hi>effects</hi> of <hi>mans</hi> own contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance. In theſe mans <hi>underſtanding</hi> is the workman, trades fashions laws languages and the like <hi>human</hi> inventions ar the matter on wch the fanſy &amp; underſtanding works; and the <hi>matter</hi> is naturally ſubject to the <hi>workman,</hi> the <hi>clay</hi> to the <hi>potter,</hi> the buil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the architect, as reaſon and ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:170217:21"/>teaches, <hi>Rom.</hi> 9.21. But in <hi>religion</hi> mans underſtanding is the clay and the will and word of God is the workman or potter to faſhion and frame it to his plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſur. Mans inventions as <hi>clay</hi> are ſubject un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to mans underſtanding as the <hi>potter,</hi> and again mans underſtanding as <hi>clay</hi> is ſubject to <hi>faith</hi> as the artificer: and the ſame rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon that makes <hi>human</hi> inventions receive alteration from <hi>man,</hi> makes mans <hi>will</hi> to receive impreſſions from <hi>religion:</hi> So lik<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe on the other ſide <hi>Religion</hi> is no more in the power of <hi>man,</hi> then is the artificer in the hand of his clay, but hath abſolut and full dominion over him, and every created intellect is fully in the power and captivity offaith.</p>
            <p>To conclud, the word and will and works of <hi>God</hi> are abſoluty ſuperiour to every <hi>created</hi> thing, and not to be alterd or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>novated by <hi>man,</hi> nor to receive either di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minution or increas from him: and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently the <hi>religion</hi> he has reveald to the ſons of men of his owne free love and bounty is to remain ſacred and untoucht by any <hi>creatur,</hi> how ever man may domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neer over his owne inventions to perfect and mend them at his pleaſur. What is
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:170217:21"/>invented and made by man may by man be either betterd or made wors at his pleaſur by what change he pleaſes: But Gods works are altogether above his creaturs reach, and his will is unch angable: He made all things perfect, and if he did not, who is he can add to their perfection. Children be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>got by men do by mans help and direction increas daily till they come to perfect age, but <hi>Adam</hi> created imediatly by God was in all liklihood made at firſt in his full per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection and growth.</p>

<pb n="28" facs="tcp:170217:24"/>by that Catholik <hi>faith</hi> wch at one and the ſame time brought into the land both the news of <hi>Christ</hi> to the ear and the ſight of the <hi>Crucifix</hi> to the eye, both the ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity of faith and the merit of <hi>works;</hi> both God in the fulneſſe of time incarnat in the bleſſed <hi>virgin,</hi> and incorporat really in the <hi>Eucharist;</hi> both <hi>feaſt</hi> daies and <hi>lents:</hi> both the <hi>popes</hi> ſupremacy, and <hi>Prieſts</hi> power; the news of <hi>purgatory</hi> as well as hell or heaven; both contrition and <hi>pennance;</hi> both God and his bleſſed retinu of <hi>Saints</hi> and Angels; both preaching and <hi>Sacrificing:</hi> ſhrins, altars, unctions, ſeaven Sacraments, vows, Pilgrimages, and all whatſoever things the <hi>Catholik</hi> now beleeves or pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſes even to the leaſt drop of holy water.

Nor is ther I am confident any one text, I ſay not any one ſingle text of <hi>Scriptur</hi> if it be taken together wth the whole body, ſcope and intention of the book whence tis drawn, that ſhall urg or proov any thing for any <hi>Reformation</hi> againſt the Church, this I am able to main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain againſt the wholl world. And yet you ar ſo far from conſidering or examining any of thes things, that you conclude upon bare hearſay or report wthout either <hi>auto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity</hi> or demonſtrative <hi>reaſon</hi> againſt the doctrin of the <hi>Church</hi> wherof ſhe hath been time out of mind in poſſeſſion: and
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:170217:26"/>all this ſlighnes is uſed in a matter of the higheſt concernment in the world, as if the talk wer onely <hi>de lana Caprina.</hi> Me thinks it ſhould fright you to think, that if your aſſertion ſhould be fals as for aught you know it is, then ar you certainly guilty of the accurſed ſacriledg of diminiſhing from the word and will of God.</p>
            <p>Again you know and do acknowledg that you have ſubſtracted not only <hi>ſome</hi> part but the <hi>moſt</hi> and greateſt parts of that <hi>religion</hi> was found planted in the land in <hi>Harry</hi> the eights daies. Pray tell me, that whol maſſ or body of practicall <hi>doctrin</hi> that is now cut off in this year 1655, was it known in King <hi>Charls, James,</hi> or Queen <hi>Eliſabeths</hi> days to have been all of it <hi>popiſh</hi> additions? To this I am ſure peopl of ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall reformations will give ſeverall anſwers. <hi>Independency</hi> the laſt and pureſt reforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion will affirm it, but <hi>Proteſtancie</hi> the firſt and oldeſt apoſtaſy will deny it; nor will the <hi>Proteſtant</hi> indure that his children ſhould judg him as he condemnd his mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>Church,</hi> or reform his fallibility as he rebeld againſt the <hi>infallibility</hi> of his parent. And yet the <hi>Independent</hi> proceeds con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequently to thoſe very principles wch the
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:170217:27"/>
               <hi>proteſtant</hi> laid for his own revolt; namely the <hi>fallibility</hi> of men, the <hi>ſoleſufficiency</hi> of ſcripturs, and the <hi>Spirit</hi> of God therin aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſting his elect to the diſcovery of truth: Nor can the <hi>Independent</hi> be blamed for any thing, but for ſtriking thes principls further hom than the <hi>amphibian</hi> proteſtant did. This I am fully aſſured of, that the <hi>Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant</hi> is not abl to bring any one argument for himſelf againſt the <hi>Independent</hi> but what he borrows from the Catholik church, and which being admitted and preſt home will deſtroy all his own <hi>proteſtancy,</hi> that is to ſay all thoſs negative wherby he differs from the <hi>Catholik,</hi> and wch he hath ſtriven thes hundred years to defend; and therfore it behovs him to take heed wt he does: for the <hi>Independent</hi> is quick and reſolut and as well verſt in his principles as himſelf, and able I am ſure wth the <hi>Proteſtants</hi> own grounds to convince him neither to be fiſh nor fleſh nor yet good red herring as the proverb ſpeaks, neither ſound <hi>Catholick</hi> nor pure <hi>reformd.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The <hi>Catholik doctrin</hi> is all fixt and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manent, and therfor every <hi>reformation</hi> can find what to <hi>deny</hi> of it, but they can never all agree together wt and how much ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:170217:27"/>to affirm; the latter ſtill denying more of the Catholick faith than the former had don alltho it proceed upon the ſame prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples wth it. The <hi>Church</hi> will eaſily make good all her <hi>affirmativs</hi> againſt you all, ſo ſoon as you ſhall agree al together how much you will <hi>deny.</hi> But ſo long as you jar one amongſt another and ſpeak contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, it is not poſſible to ſtop all your mouths at once. In a word all the changes made by the <hi>Independent</hi> are either legall juſt and religious, or els <hi>proteſtancy</hi> it ſelf is an unjuſt, illegall and impious apoſtaſy: for if <hi>all men</hi> be obnoxious to errour, and the <hi>Scriptur</hi> ſole judg and guid of faith; by wt right can the <hi>Proteſtant</hi> oblige men to her tenets further than they approov of them by the teſt of <hi>Scriptur</hi> wch they hav in in their own hands: if thos principles be fals wth wt juſtice did the <hi>Proteſtant</hi> him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf revolt from the <hi>Catholik</hi> upon thoſe ſole grounds? Nay the <hi>Independent</hi> is far more honeſt and excuſabl than the <hi>prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant,</hi> for he prefers his judgment onely be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore a <hi>Church</hi> that profeſt her ſelf to be <hi>fallible;</hi> but the <hi>proteſtant</hi> rebeld againſt an <hi>infallible</hi> guid and one that profeſt her ſelf ſuch. And altho the Catholik <hi>Church</hi>
               <pb n="36" facs="tcp:170217:28"/>wer not infallible, yet profeſſing her ſelf in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallible ſhe has that caus of blaming the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volting <hi>protestant,</hi> wch the proteſtant can never hav againſt the <hi>Independent:</hi> for an infallible Church may well expect an uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſall ſubjection; whereas the <hi>proteſtant</hi> profeſſing herſelf fallible cannot in mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſty either oblige peopl to her cannons, or diſlik their freedom of judgment however diſſenting from her own. And ſo ſhe muſt needs have the <hi>Preſbyterian</hi> excuſd; and the Presbyterian he cannot do otherwiſe than comend the <hi>Independent,</hi> as the nim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bler work man. For ſith both of them went about to mend the Proteſtant <hi>refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation,</hi> and correct the dictats of that <hi>fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lible</hi> miſtres, the <hi>Independent</hi> did his work more ſpeedily and fully than the other, and ſo indeed may be maliced by him as the better workman but never blamed. Finally, if this laſt reformation of <hi>Independency</hi> be indeed an aboliſhing of all reliques of <hi>pope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry</hi> hanging upon the <hi>Proteſtant</hi> and not clearly caſheerd by the <hi>Presbyterian;</hi> then does the <hi>Catholik</hi> and <hi>Independent</hi> ſtand like extrems, having the intermediat refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mations of Proteſtancy and Presbytery and the like between then two, as white and
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:170217:28"/>black be the two extrems of colours, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween which are red blew green and the like borrowing their exiſtency from the natur of both in a ſeverall mixtur: And all other reformations interjacent are diver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſified in themſelvs according as they do mor or les partake of the Catholik <hi>poſitivs,</hi> and Independents <hi>negativs.</hi> Theſe two claim an abſolute liberty of conſcience in their own territories, the Catholick a free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of the <hi>Churches</hi> judgment, the Inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendent of his <hi>own</hi> particular. And either all is true that the Catholik <hi>affirms,</hi> or all the independent <hi>denys.</hi>

            </sp>
            <p>Thes ſpeciall commiſſions do ever bring
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:170217:29"/>with them ſome peculiar ſeals and letters patents ſuch as heaven uſes to ſend to man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind: as be ſigns, wondrous operations and miracles, wthout wch man cannot in reaſon deſert his ſtation. Reformers had none of thes to ſhow. But I will not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt hereon (altho it be a worthy and waighty conſideration) becaus tis copi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly don by others. I ſay then</p>
            <p>Firſt it would ſeem ſtrang to a reaſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nabl man and a thing of much ſuſpition, that all <hi>reformations</hi> are but <hi>negativ</hi> abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litions of the ancient Catholik religion without any <hi>poſitiv</hi> inſtitution at all. Tis an odd kind of dreſſing a garden ſtill to be grubbing up trees, and never plant any in the place; nor is it likly God ſhould ſend <hi>workmen</hi> into his vineyard onely to <hi>deſtroy</hi> and pull up.</p>
            <p>Again <hi>reformers</hi> do all of them equally pretend to be ſent from <hi>God</hi> wth an extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary commiſſion to enlighten the world. And yet they all hitherto did their work to the halfs, keeping ſtill as much <hi>po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pery</hi> as they caſt away. Gods <hi>extraordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry</hi> meſſengers uſe not to do their work <hi>imperfectly,</hi> or remain themſelvs in that <hi>er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour</hi> they were ſent on purpos to <hi>correct
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:170217:29"/>Martin Luther</hi> that extraordinary light of the world did if we may beleeve the ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding <hi>reformations</hi> both liv and dy in as much <hi>popery</hi> as himſelf aboliſhed. If <hi>popery</hi> be ſo damnable, as both <hi>Luther</hi> and other reformers cry out and ſay it is, I ſhould think that half a ſcore ſwinging articles of <hi>popery</hi> are enough to ſink a man: and ſo much <hi>Luther</hi> muſt keep ſtil if we beleev the following <hi>reformation,</hi> and this detaind no les if we may credit the third. The purity of theſe times found ſo much <hi>popiſhnes</hi> ſtill hanging on <hi>Proteſtants</hi> skirts, that they thought it worth the hazard of their lives to bruſh it off. And ſom think that even theſe pureſt are not themſelves abſolutly free from it; and ſurely never wil be, ſo long as the <hi>Bible</hi> wch is the <hi>Popes</hi> book and ſent immediatly from him into this iſland, is yet in their hands.</p>
            <p>Ar all theſe reformers ſent from God? why then did non of them doe their work to the full, till at the end of a full age the <hi>Independent</hi> ſtept in to accompliſh it, if yet he hath himſelf don the deed to the ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt.</p>
            <p>Why ſhould I think ill onely of the <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholik</hi> whom <hi>Luther</hi> raild againſt, and not
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:170217:30"/>as well hate <hi>Luther</hi> whom <hi>Calvin</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnd; or judg <hi>Calvin</hi> whom the <hi>Proteſtant</hi> church of England cenſurd in many things and forſook; or deteſt alſo the <hi>Proteſtant Church</hi> wch the purity of thes times have deſtroied. Sith we be all ſo much ſeverd from one another, whence is it that we all conſpire to hate, condemn and rail againſt the Catholik <hi>Church,</hi> having as much cauſe to inveigh againſt one another and let her alone, as to rail againſt her alone and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaud one another. This is a ſhrewd ſign we ar all rebels to that one <hi>Church</hi> and hav no truth amongſt our ſelvs. For one <hi>truth</hi> is oppoſit to twenty <hi>falſhoods</hi> and theſe falſhoods however they be contrary to one another, that one primary truth ſtill ſtands againſt them all. <hi>Catilin</hi> and <hi>Cethegus</hi> and the other conſpiratours againſt <hi>Rome</hi> their mother City could fall out one amongſt another, tho they jointly reſiſted her, and ſhe as indifferently confronted them all.</p>
            <p>Beſids, theſe <hi>reformers</hi> muſt needs be liars all of them if we may beleeve any of them. For as they did moſt vehemently inveigh againſt that part of <hi>popery</hi> wch themſelves <hi>rejected;</hi> ſo did they tooth and nail defend the purity of that portion they
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:170217:30"/>ſtill <hi>retaind,</hi> wch by the ſucceeding <hi>refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mers</hi> was deeply cenſurd and condemnd: And ſo from the very firſt to the laſt, they ſtill condemned one another for wt they <hi>retaind,</hi> as the <hi>Church</hi> of God condemnd them all for wt they <hi>rejected.</hi> Who ſhall unfold this riddle or tell me in wch <hi>refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation</hi> the truth lies? Surely in non of them, if by the mouth of two witneſſes a truth may be eſtabliſhed: for ther is ever the Catholik <hi>Church</hi> and one <hi>reformation</hi> againſt the judgment of any other refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation; &amp; every ſect hath ſtill the <hi>Church</hi> againſt her for one, and ſome other ſect if not all other reformations beſides.</p>
            <p>Ar all thes men ſent from <hi>God</hi> for one and the ſame thing, &amp; yet all fail in doing it, and al condemnd by one another in the deed? Still wt any one of them caſts away is <hi>popery,</hi> and what he keeps is the ſincere <hi>word</hi> and will of God, tho not only the <hi>Church</hi> that cenſurs them all together but even all other <hi>reformations</hi> ſay the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary.</p>
            <p>So that if we put all judgments together ther will reſult thus much? That the <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholik</hi> on the one ſide, &amp; all <hi>ſectaries</hi> of ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verall opinions on the other, they be all
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:170217:31"/>
               <hi>Papiſts;</hi> and differ but <hi>ſecundum magis &amp; minus:</hi> So that the <hi>Roman</hi> is a Catholik <hi>Papiſt,</hi> and all the reſt be heretick <hi>Papiſts,</hi> but <hi>Papists</hi> all. For every ſect is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnd by his fellowes of ſome <hi>popery,</hi> and the <hi>Church</hi> as the ſource of all. And in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed all ſects do retain ſom thing more or les of that religion and faith wch our land received at firſt from the <hi>pape,</hi> and wtſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever poſitive doctrin they ſtill keep they had it onginally from him. At leaſt they keep all of them the <hi>Bible</hi> eyther whol or in part, wch is the great book of the <hi>pope</hi> wch he ever ſends wth his miſſioners (ſince he orderd and canoniſed it) to any na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions converſion, as conformable to the great rule of Chriſtian faith wch is tradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. And conſequently if the <hi>Papiſt</hi> be a child of <hi>Antichriſt,</hi> all ſectaries are no other, ſo far as they be <hi>Chriſtian</hi> or have any thing of Chriſtianity amongſt them: onely wth this difference, that the mark of the <hi>beast,</hi> if he be a beaſt, is leſſe in ſom than it is in others; but tis in the for heads of all ſo many as be baptiſed and beleeve in <hi>Christ,</hi> by his means and miſſioners, and by the Sacraments and precepts they had originally from him.</p>

            </sp>
            <p>Take the four generall opinions that be now in <hi>England;</hi> the Catholick, the Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant, Presbyterian and independent: Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſid er ſeriouſly and you ſhall find that as they be antecedent in time, ſo ſtill the ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding is but a deficiencie from the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>goer, and the laſt the greateſt negation of the poſitions laid by the firſt; yet ſtill what he holds poſitively he hath it from him; and the firſt wch is the Catholik had all
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:170217:32"/>his whole poſitive faith from the Pope, as himſelf profeſſes and our own hiſtories witneſſe; part whereof was cut of by the Proteſtant, as the Presbyterian after him took away ſome things wch the Proteſtant ſtill retaind, and the Independent others wch the Presbyterian kept.</p>
            <p>He is very ignorant in hiſtory that diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerns not by his reading, how the Catholik now exiſtent in <hi>England</hi> retains univerſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly all the points of faith wch were brought hither into <hi>England</hi> at its converſion from paganiſme by S. <hi>Auſtin</hi> and other good children of bleſſed <hi>S.

Nor hath he any parcell of faith either over or under wt he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived then, ſo that the Catholik is a papiſt in print, and a legitimat child of that ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerable paſtour.</p>
            <p>A thouſand years after the Saxes or Engliſh-mens converſion, and the unani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous profeſſion of the Catholik faith all
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:170217:32"/>that while, in an unluky howt riſes <hi>Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther</hi> who having been himſelf born and and bred up in the boſome of the Church through the inſtigation of Satan and his two inſtruments pride and luſt apoſtatiſed from the Church and made a reformation as he called it, wherunto the worſt of peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple at firſt adhered, altho now both wiſe and honeſt minded people go along wth it, not ſo much by their own choiſe as un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortunate cuſtome. This proteſtancy took away at once almoſt three parts of the Churches practicall doctrin, retaining the ſpeculative. Within the compaſſe of ten years, it had run into ſeverall diviſions or ſubreformations in <hi>Germany, Holland, Switzerland and Geneva.</hi> Upon <hi>Harry</hi> the eights ſchiſm and afterward theſe people of ſeverall <hi>Reformations</hi> cam flocking over into England, by whos ſeverall directions to pleas all parties was made up that mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcellan of the Engliſh <hi>proteſtancy,</hi> by re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection of ſeverall points of the <hi>Catholik</hi> faith then in our land, ſome according to <hi>Luther,</hi> others according to <hi>Calvin,</hi> Swin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glius &amp; the reſt, together wth an eſtabliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of an apiſh prelacy in ſtead of the <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholik</hi> one (wch had beene overthrown) for
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:170217:33"/>the ſecurity of the ſtate and of the fond Church they had then ſet up; the other few remainds of our Catholik faith now wholly diſmembred, yet ſtanding as the baſe of this <hi>humane</hi> ſuperſtructur.</p>
            <p>Under this <hi>Proteſtant</hi> prelacy differing from all other reformations in the world bred the <hi>Puritan</hi> who was ſo chekt &amp; kept under all the raigne of <hi>K. Iames,</hi> that when he came to be teemd forth, by ſtrength of natur and multitud of ſeed he was born double and came two forth together, the <hi>younger</hi> brother ſupplanting the <hi>elder</hi> and thruſting himſelf into his place even in that inſtant that the elder had eat himſelf a paſſage through his <hi>Proteſtant</hi> mothers bowells. This was the <hi>Presbyterian</hi> and <hi>Jndependent</hi> both rejecting ſomthing of that had been conveyed to them by the <hi>Proteſtant,</hi> but the <hi>Independent</hi> more than the other. But what either of them kept he received it by the Proteſtant, as the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtant had done from the <hi>Catholik</hi> the ſole univerſall Profeſſour of the whol Chriſtian faith.</p>
            <p>Now then the whol body of Chriſtian faith and doctrin kept by the <hi>Catholik,</hi> as it was wholly receivd at firſt from the <hi>pope</hi>
               <pb n="47" facs="tcp:170217:33"/>the generall father of the Chriſtian church, ſo muſt it needs be all indifferently <hi>Papi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſticall</hi> upon that account, and not that part onely wch a <hi>Reformer</hi> diſlikes and calls ſo; and conſequently every parcell therof <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taind</hi> by any Reformer is as properly Papi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſticall as wt he <hi>rejects,</hi> and altho he cals it not ſo, yet tis ſo ſtiled by another Refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer who likes not to retain it as he does; and for no other reaſon but becauſe as it iſſued, ſo is it maintaind and practiſed by the <hi>popiſh</hi> Church; wch reaſon holds good as well in him that likes it as him thy likes it not.</p>
            <p>By this rule it will follow irrefragably that all the four profeſſours be papiſts, as alſo be all others who profeſſe Chriſtiani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty upon the face of the whole earth, either in whole or part, aſwell thoſe that keep their whole faith entire and reſpect the Pape, as they that retain onely ſome part and defy him: for ingratitud and pride can exempt no man from the denominatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſo long as he ſtill beleeves or practiſes any part of that Chriſtianity has been handed to him from the Pope and Popiſh Church, as all men in <hi>England</hi> I am ſure do; and to avoid all further cavill tis ſolely of them I now ſpeak.</p>

It would be ridiculous for the laſt deſcendents becauſe they want much of the perſon &amp; ſtatur of the firſt originall or ſtock, to deny that they have therfore any thing of him or from him, &amp; ſpeaking againſt thoſe ſeverall inches they have not, at the ſame time to magnifie the few inches wch they have and blaſpheme him from whence they have received them. And yet this is directly the caſe of all re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formers and reformations, to boaſt of the Chriſtianity they keep and villify that part they reject, as ſuperſtitious and popiſh; whereas both wt they reject and wt they keep did deſcend equally and indifferent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly from the Popiſh or Catholick Church. And if our Engliſh ſectaries ſhould ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der up to the Pope and Popiſh Church all they have had from her, I do not know any one poſitiv point of Chriſtianity, ſpeculativ or practicall they ſhould have remaining
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:170217:34"/>except that harmonious ſong of mellifluous Robin red breaſt <hi>Preſerv us Lord.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thus much may ſuffice to ſhow that all <hi>England</hi> be Papiſts, ſome Catholick Papiſts other heretick Papiſts, but Papiſts all. Sith every part of Chriſtian faith brought alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether in one entire body of doctrine by a meſſenger of Pope <hi>Gregory</hi> to the Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh at our converſion from paganiſme was equally papiſticall, equally received in the Catholik church, and with the like indif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferency communicated to our land from her Head and Paſtour. And the having of it more or leſs maks ſom leſs <hi>papiſts</hi> than others, but not no <hi>papiſts</hi> Even as in muſick if a <hi>ſem breef</hi> be a full time, a <hi>minnom</hi> tho it be but half ſo much is a notion of time, ſo is likwis a <hi>crotchet</hi> tho it be but half a min<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nom, and a <hi>quaver</hi> wch is but half a crotchet: ſo that a minnom is half a ſem breef, a crochet the fourth part, and a qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver tho it be but the eight part, yet a part it is and nothing els. Even ſo be thes four ſeverall religions in <hi>England</hi> every one of them either complet popery or part of it, the <hi>Catholick</hi> as it were a ſeem breef, the <hi>proteſtant</hi> a minnom, the <hi>Presbyterian</hi> a a crochet and the <hi>Independent</hi> a quaver, And
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:170217:35"/>truly to keep one piece of popery and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject others deliverd by the ſame hands, and upon the very ſelfſame grounds, ſeems to me neither a ſafe cours nor yet a reaſonabl proceeding. For the whol ſtream of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian doctrin was deliverd unto us as iſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing indifferently from a divin originall; and if this report be true, no man may tampar or meddl at all in that ſacred iſſue of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vin will, as I have already ſhown: if fals, tis all equally to be rejected, and paganiſm or atheiſm to ſucceed in its place.</p>
            <p>But our <hi>reformers</hi> will have that to be popery or human wch any of them rejects wthout ever rendring a reaſon therof, to ſatisfy any moderat and indifferent man; ſith what ever they ſay againſt any one thing may be as well applied to any other. Nor is <hi>religion</hi> like philoſophy to be held by the propability it carrys in our under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding, for then it wer not faith but <hi>rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon,</hi> nor ſhould our underſtandings be otherwis captivated to <hi>divin</hi> revelations that to <hi>human</hi> poſitions, or ſubjected to God more than to man. And yet again, if probability ſhould carry it, a wiſe judici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous man that is unprejudiced in his judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment ſhall I am comfident find more diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:170217:35"/>to beleev the very hiſtory of the <hi>Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble</hi> than any articl of the <hi>Catholik</hi> religion rejected by reformers; and as much reaſon to keep all articles as any.</p>
            <p>But ſith reformers will have that <hi>popery</hi> wch any of them rejects, &amp; that he retains pure Goſpell; I for my part grant both. But then I make no difference at all betwixt <hi>popery</hi> and pure <hi>Gospell:</hi> nay the Goſpell is ſo far pure as it is conformable to <hi>popery</hi> &amp; the traditionall doctrin of the Catholik <hi>church,</hi> wch is the rule and ſquare of all preachings, Writings, Letters, Sermons, E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſtls, Goſpell andall.</p>
            <p>And therfor that any <hi>reformation</hi> in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion is a purification of the Goſpell from <hi>popery</hi> taken in your ſens, that is to ſay from human inventions ſuperſtitions and er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours, this I muſt flatly deny; or that the <hi>popery</hi> men exclaim againſt is any ſuch thing. And as I can never my ſelf be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaded to the contrary, ſo me thinks I ſhould perſwade even you my dear Lady and you alſo Mr <hi>Parſon</hi> with your witty bedfellow to be of my mind.</p>

               <p>By your favour ſweet Miſtres, I have heard ſay that S. <hi>Marks</hi> Goſpell was writ-ten in <hi>Rome,</hi> firſt and originally in La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tin, I find alſo in my <hi>Bible</hi> that ſome of <hi>Pauls</hi> Epiſtls were written and dated from <hi>Rome,</hi> as thoſe he wrote to the <hi>Galatians, Epheſians, Philippians, Coloſſians,</hi> the ſecond to <hi>Timothy,</hi> that to <hi>Philemon</hi> and haply that to the <hi>Hebrews</hi> wch was dated from <hi>Italy.</hi> And the Epiſtle which was written on pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe to the <hi>Romans,</hi> was aſſuredly carried to <hi>Rome</hi> before it was brought hither, and muſt come thence to us. So that if they did come from heaven, it ſeems <hi>Rome</hi> is either heaven it ſelf or in the way twixt us and heaven, for they were there firſt either brought thither or written there; and thence cam over into <hi>England</hi> and other countries.</p>
            </sp>
            <p>But to turn to you Sr. <hi>Harry,</hi> me thinks you ar now too confident, and ſeem to put on a refolution too much oppoſit to the hopes I have of you, and conſequently to the hopes you may hav of me, for I cannot

               <p>I am ready Sr to prove from point to point, that al we hav in our reformation rejected is the pure inventions of men, whereof the principal is that <hi>tyrant</hi> of <hi>Rome</hi> that Babylonian <hi>Antichriſt</hi> the Pope.</p>

               <p>We will not deſcend unto particulars as yet. Giv me leav now only to tell you in
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:170217:37"/>generall, that thoſe rejected parcells of our ancient Catholik faith cannot in any pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bability be thought human inventions.</p>
               <p>For the Roman <hi>Catholik church</hi> whence all our religion iſſued, doth own them in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>differently wth the reſt for integrall parts of the Chriſtianity ſhe at firſt deliverd. And <hi>reformers</hi> never yet agreed together wt or how many of thoſe parcells wer <hi>hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi> and upon that account to be rejected. And yet if they had had any certain know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg either from God or man, either by hiſtory or grounded reaſon, they would not wth ſo much diſagreement amongſt one another hav by degrees caſt off ſom one part ſome another of that religion they receivd at firſt altogether upon one &amp; the ſam motiv of the Revealers <hi>infallibility.</hi> This diſagreement of reformers as it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not but bring themſelvs if they would but open their eyes into ſome ſuſpitio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of uncer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty; ſo to me unto whom uncertain grounds of faith are no grounds at all, they ar a ſufficient conviction of errour &amp; fraud.</p>
            </sp>
            <p>Again, theſe preſented <hi>popiſh</hi> ſuperſtiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons and human inventions rejected even by <hi>Protestancy</hi> were both very many and verry weighty, at about the reall preſence,
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:170217:37"/>apoſtolicall traditions, the papes ſupremacy merit of good works, ſacrifice of maſſ, ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cramentall abſolution, uſe of images, invo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of Saints, ſeaven ſacraments, vows, ſhrines, prieſthood and the like, even in a manner the whole body of practical reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion. Thes if they be additions of man muſt either be ignorantly taken up by the <hi>people,</hi> or impoſed upon them by their <hi>pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lats.</hi> As for the <hi>peopl,</hi> if nothing at the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning had ere been taught them but on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to <hi>beleev in Chriſt,</hi> it is not poſſible mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally ſpeaking that ſuch things as thes ſhould ever com into their heads: but tis al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>together and abſolutly impoſſible that they ſhould be taken up univerſally by all peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of the earth together, and that not by parcells as now they are caſt away; but the whol body of them together wth ſuch uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and conſent as hath been ever found in all <hi>Chriſtian</hi> kingdoms of the world, none of the peopl in any kingdom gain ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing their fellows, nor Prelats reſiſting.</p>
            <p>If you ſay, the <hi>Prelats</hi> impoſed them: This muſt be don either by violence or fraud, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther by ſtrong hand or ſom inſenſibl intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duction. Such main weighty tangible points as thes wch were to be brought not onely
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:170217:38"/>into peopls heads but hands, and daily and hourly to be practiſd, can never be thought by any ſenſibl man to have been <hi>inſenſibly</hi> introduced or <hi>inſenſibly</hi> receivd or <hi>inſenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly</hi> liked of, wth ſo much prejudice of car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall eas and ſenſuality; I ſay wth ſo much <hi>prejudice of ſenſuality</hi> as faſtings, watchings, almſdeeds, juſticiary ſatisfaction, vows of poverty obedience and chaſtity, pennances, cloiſturs and religious monaſteries muſt needs bring upon the world.</p>
            <p>For the ſame reaſon <hi>violence</hi> offred to the people whether at the ſame time or ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verall ages in ſuch buſineſſes of main im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portance, of great weight, and of much ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vitud could never paſs ſo ſmoothly or be ſo tamly admitted by all <hi>Christian</hi> king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms, wherof ſome be at deadly feud, op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition and war with one another, others of a natur more refractory and not ſo carfull to keep wt they have once receivd, ſom ſooner ſom later converted, ſo that no nois ſhould be made therof, no cours ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken to reſiſt it, no diſlike of the doctrin, no difformity of beleef.</p>
            <p>He can never beleeve this who knowes either the nature of the <hi>world,</hi> or the diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition of the Catholik <hi>Church.</hi> The <hi>world</hi>
               <pb n="57" facs="tcp:170217:38"/>is naturally tumultuous, impatient of new yokes, apt to inſurrections, ſlow to admit a reſtraint, and no les prone to omit ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glect and reject wt is ſervilely impoſd upon them, eſpecially if it be don wthout juſt autority and contrary to peopls inclina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.</p>
            <p>The Catholik <hi>Church</hi> on the other ſide he that knows her and hath beheld her pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedings from age to age, may eaſily diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern how tickliſh and ſcrupulous ſhe is, how ſhe ſtartls at the very news of the leaſt <hi>innovation</hi> or new fangldnes in any of her peopl, wch if it do increas how ſmall ſo ever the matter may be in it ſelf, the <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholik body</hi> riſes up againſt it &amp; will not reſt till by a councell it be condemnd. This is the motiv of calling ſo many <hi>councells</hi> as have been ſince Chriſtianity firſt began, and of the ſeverity ther uſed even in ſom things a man would hardly deem conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable. It would even delight a man rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding the hiſtory of the <hi>church</hi> in learned <hi>Baronius</hi> and others, to ſee the Churches induſtry and watchfulnes on all occaſions to prevent new fangldnes: the labour and diligence of her councells; their faithfulnes ſtudy and exactneſſe in examining, diſcus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing,
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:170217:39"/>refuting upſtart <hi>opinions;</hi> their up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rightnes and wiſdom in defining &amp; confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming the ancient <hi>Catholik doctrin</hi> againſt all <hi>innovations</hi> according to that general oracle of all Synods <hi>Nihil innovandum, veterum traditionibus ſtandum;</hi> and laſtly the ſevere penaltys inflicted by the <hi>church</hi> upon the authours of <hi>innovation</hi> if they did not humbly recant their errour, ſo that all things conſidered aright, tis as impoſſible for human <hi>innovations</hi> to incorporate wth the <hi>body</hi> of anicent <hi>Catholik faith</hi> as for wood or ſtone to concorporate wth the fleſh of an animal.</p>

D<hi rend="sup">r</hi>.</hi> ſave me the labour of perſwading this truth any further, if you would pleas to call to mind, how ſeverall <hi>Reformers</hi> have taunted at the ſcrupuloſity of <hi>papiſts</hi> in this kind, yea and inveighed too againſt their ſeverity; telling us that <hi>popiſh</hi> councels are ſo ſcrupulouſly ſevere that they queſtion, meddle wth and cenſur things that ar of little or no concernment at all in <hi>Religion</hi> and oftims pure Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſophy; that they condemne <hi>good books</hi> written by their owne people and thoſe men of ſincerity and conſcience one can hardly tell why or wherfore; that they ſo
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:170217:39"/>enſlave excellent wits that they cannot invent or utter any thing that may relliſh never ſo little of <hi>novelty;</hi> that they <hi>judg</hi> the faithfull and caſt them out of the <hi>church</hi> even for ſmall ſuppoſed deviations; that they ſet up <hi>inquiſitions</hi> to prevent and ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſe <hi>liberty</hi> of <hi>conſcience</hi> even wth un-Chriſtian cruelty. And they tell us ſeverall ſtorys of the Catholik churches <hi>ſcrupuloſity</hi> in this kind: of <hi>Heliodor</hi> put out of his by<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhoprick for writing his fained <hi>Romance;</hi> of <hi>Virgilius</hi> diſplaced in like ſort for tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching that ther were Antipodes, an opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on in thoſe daies new and unheard of; of a <hi>Printer</hi> that together wth the loſſe of his place ſufferd a heavy mulct for altering one letter wch had been falſly tranſcribed in that parable of the <hi>woman that loſt a drachme and ſwept her houſe, &amp; evertit do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mum;</hi> the Printer for <hi>evertit</hi> made it <hi>ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit</hi> as it ought to be, and forfeited ſay they his office for his pains.</p>
            <p>It is poſſible that ſo much curioſity, ſo much ſcrupuloſity and tendernes ſhould ſo tamely admit of an inſupportable weight of <hi>popery</hi> wthout any diſturbance at all, nay wth the liking and univerſall conſent of all men. God Catholikes are as tender of
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:170217:40"/>their <hi>faith</hi> as of the apple of their eye; ſo that if a friend or kinsman ſhould once take up any <hi>noveltys</hi> therin, we are ſcanda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſed at it, riſe up againſt him &amp; cannot but ſhow our averſion and diſlike even wher natur and cuſtom had united us. Nor can any one of our country-men broch an <hi>hereſy,</hi> but all ſound <hi>Catholiks</hi> will hate him for it and riſe up againſt him: forrei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners if it ever com to their ears will deteſt him much more; how ever he may draw ſome diſciples after him, ſuch light capri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious people as will be led away wth every <hi>wind of doctrin:</hi> and ſom ſuch there have ever been who forgetfull of God and their own ſafty will leav the <hi>rock</hi> of the <hi>church</hi> wherupon they are built to follow the new fangldnes of a proud inſtable mind; the whole <hi>Catholik body</hi> ſtill reſiſting and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demning the inſolence. This is a quality as evident in good catholiks as that a man hath a noſe in his face, nor needs it proof.</p>
            <p>How then can it be thought that whol Kingdoms and ſeverall nations ſhould ſubmit to the judgment of one proud <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viatour,</hi> be he never ſo witty ov eloquent; as for example all the Prelats of <hi>Spain, Italy, Germany, France, Eaſt</hi> and <hi>Weſt-Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dys,
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:170217:40"/>Aſia,</hi> in a word all over the world, to one haughty ſelf conceited <hi>Engliſh</hi> Prieſt deviating from the ancient received faith of his ances tours, wthout any reſiſtance diſlike or noiſe. It is not a thing by a rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable man ſo much as to be imagind. Nor hath a prelate in one countrey any more power over the prelates of another than <hi>wit</hi> and <hi>eloquence</hi> can afford him, wch reaſon and experience ſhowes can ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver ſuffice for the bringing of all mankind into <hi>captivity</hi> to it ſelf wthout reſiſtance and clamour. The <hi>chief Prieſt</hi> is the fitteſt to offer this kind of violence: and yet how little he is able to prevail in an opinion contrary to the Churches <hi>univerſall tradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> appears ſufficiently in the fact of pope <hi>Iohn</hi> the twenty ſecond, who propounding to the conſideration of ſome Chriſtian <hi>univerſities</hi> the negativ of the ſoules fineal beatitud till the generall judgment, effe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted no more but a commotion of the Chriſtian world againſt himſelf. And the thing is remembred and ſpoke of to this day. Wherfor neither <hi>covin</hi> nor <hi>violence</hi> can be of any avail to the introducing of <hi>innovations</hi> by any perſon wtſoever con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to the churches cuſton and tradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>

How then can you ever hope to perſwade me that all or any of theſe be <hi>innovations,</hi> wherof you can tell me neither the motiv, nor the occaſion, nor the time they were introduced, nor the perſon by whom nor any event that followed theron. Tis an argument of deſperat wretchednes to caſt away all <hi>practicall religion</hi> upon no other account than the bare affirmation that tis <hi>popiſh</hi> ſuperſtition and <hi>popiſh</hi> inventions.</p>

            <p>But if we conſider the promiſes of God to conſerv his church in all truth, and for that end to be ever wth it even to the worlds conſummation; and that it is now granted on all hands that the church hath not been viſibly exiſtent in all times and places, but onely in and by the <hi>Roman Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholik:</hi> then will it appear altogether im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible that <hi>human</hi> inventions and falſitys ſhould ever be able to thruſt in to that <hi>church</hi> or go for truths.</p>

<pb n="65" facs="tcp:170217:42"/>that the <hi>church of Chriſt</hi> was firſt raiſed upon divine principles, and ſetled upon the wiſedom of God unto eternall perma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nence. And yet if ſhe ſhould admit of all theſe <hi>mixturs</hi> ſhe would ceaſe to be <hi>ſpotles</hi> and <hi>unblamable,</hi> and conſequently ceaſe to be her ſelf. In all things much of ill cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupts the good; but <hi>Religion</hi> if it be not ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolutly ſincere is not properly religion. For ther is ſomthing of good even in <hi>paga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſme</hi> and <hi>mahometiſme,</hi> wch no man calls religion but ſuperſtition: the denomina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion following the greater and worſer part.</p>

<pb n="66" facs="tcp:170217:43"/>both before God and man.</hi> This diſcourſe in ſubſtance, for I have not the book now by me to ſet down juſt punctually his words, is over and over repeated in his book, and is indeed one of the chief ropes wherupon that fanatick funambulo dances.

<pb n="72" facs="tcp:170217:46"/>have ſtill pretended it; nay the <hi>devill</hi> urged his temptation wth a <hi>ſcriptum eſt, Matt.</hi> 4. ſo that I feare the propoſall of this either means or reſt will prove but waſt of time.</p>
            </sp>
            <p>Give me leav to tell you, that the meſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger of the Goſpell of peace who by a mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion from pope <hi>Eleutherius</hi> converted the <hi>Brittons</hi> from payniſme to Chriſtian faith in the ſecond age of the church, and the other from pope <hi>Gregorius</hi> who reduced the <hi>Saxes</hi> or <hi>Engliſh</hi> in the fift gave them all their religion as well <hi>explicitly</hi> in all the articles of their Chriſtian faith, as <hi>impli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citly</hi> in the bible they deliverd into their hands, wherin thoſe articles by incidentall occaſion lay caſually coucht. Now to take away all thoſe <hi>explicite</hi> articles dreſt and prepared allready to our hands, and give us the bible, is the ſame thing as to take from men all the <hi>gold</hi> and <hi>ſilver</hi> already coined wth ſo much care and induſtry of princes, and ſhow them <hi>a mine</hi> whence ſuch things may be digd, wthout affording ey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>work men</hi> skilfull in the art or <hi>inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments</hi> for the purpos.</p>
            <p>Imagin in ſuch a caſe wt diſorder and confuſion would happen, when thouſands of people are gatherd together about a
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:170217:46"/>
               <hi>mountain;</hi> none verſt in <hi>digging</hi> or fitted wth inſtruments for it, none accuſtomed to the <hi>hollowes</hi> of deep earth, none skild in finding out the <hi>vein,</hi> none expert in diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the <hi>oare,</hi> or to melt it into <hi>bullion</hi> or ſtamp it into <hi>coin.</hi> And yet all of them <hi>equally conceyted</hi> as undertaking ignorance uſes to be, and indifferently <hi>judging</hi> and condemning the works of each other. It cannot otherwiſe happen in ſuch a caſe, but that ſome ſhould tumble into precipices, ſome be ſomtherd in the earth below, ſome after much toil bring forth a handfull of clodded earth, lead or iron oare, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps a ſlat or peble in the ſtead of met<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall: and if haply any one meet wth the right, he will either not heed it as not appearing to be ſuch, or looſe it in the al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lay, melting or ſtamp. In fine, where ſo much curioſity and art is required in the manifold degrees of procedur, yet none <hi>had</hi> by any and <hi>profeſt</hi> by all to the diſpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragement of one another, wt can reſult from ſuch an attempt but diſorder &amp; nois, confuſion and hazard, emulation &amp; quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rell amongſt themſelves. Nov can they ever effect any thing to the generall agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment &amp; liking of all, or repair the <hi>coin</hi> that is deſtroyd.</p>
            <pb n="74" facs="tcp:170217:47"/>
            <p>This is in all points our very condition; when the <hi>Chriſtian articles</hi> of faith wrougt out and ſtampt for us, and deliverd us by our primitiv paſtours according as they had received them from <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> the prime Inventour and Work-man of our faith are principitouſly annuld, and the Bible put in mens hands to dig out from thence by their own skill and induſtry the reſults of their religion.</p>
            <p>Nay the caſe here is ſo much the more deſperat, in that the common people wth the tradition of the Bible receiv this cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion from the <hi>reformers;</hi> that they take heed of ſuch and ſuch abrogated articles of <hi>popery,</hi> wch as they do ever and anon ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear in the <hi>Scripturs</hi> they hav to peruſe, ſo are they indeed the very pith and marrow of that ſacred Book, and the <hi>golden metall</hi> they are onely to ſeek for. So that being left unto their own ſhallow judgments if it were then improbable they ſhould ever light upon the whol ſincere truth of good: now being adviced and prejudiced againſt it, altho they ſhould happly light upon it, tis impoſſible wth that prejudice they ſhould ever embrace and adhere un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to it.</p>
            <pb n="75" facs="tcp:170217:47"/>
            <p>That the articles of <hi>Catholik religion</hi> abrogated by <hi>reformers</hi> were all ſtampt out for us by our primitiv Paſtours and have gon currant in the whol <hi>Chriſtian</hi> world from the beginning to this day, hath been proved a hundred times over and over by learned Catholik divines both for the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall &amp; in each particular. And that it is an impious tiranny to take them all away and put people to ſeek new out of the <hi>Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,</hi> I think it will eaſily appear to an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding man, if he do but conſider the way-wardnes of <hi>mans will</hi> prone to evill and averſt to good, ſuch eſpecially as is an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>next to bitternes and pains, the fallacy of his <hi>fanſy</hi> and weaknes of his <hi>underſtanding</hi> wch we cannot but perceiv to fail even in things that be in our very ſenſes, and that both by deficiency and errour, both by want of apprehenſion and falſity of judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment: or if we conſider on the other ſide the <hi>obſcurity</hi> of Scriptur, not in it ſelf but in order to our weak, obſcure, ſens-perverted intellect. Upon wch two generall Heads it coms to pas that men ſo frequently <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prave the Scriptures to their own perdition<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi> as Scriptur it ſelf complaineth 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3.</p>
            <p>But over and above all this, to put men
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:170217:48"/>to put men to ſeek for a thing wth a fore-imprinted <hi>prejudice</hi> of that they go to find, to ſeek for faith with a prejudice againſt faith, is a tirannous cheat and abuſe hardly to be paraleld.</p>
            <p>If to people met together to try or ſearch for ſilver and gold, one ſhould give ſuch like inſtructions, Take al that comes to hand; tis all good howſoever compoſed or mixt, two kinds onely excepted; ſuch parts of earth as hav much of <hi>friability</hi> and <hi>inconſiſtency</hi> in them, lay hold of them: if there be any body co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>poſed of <hi>impure</hi> earth <hi>liquefied</hi> take that: if the earth, be not wel <hi>vanquiſht,</hi> &amp; the parts much <hi>diſſimilar,</hi> tis good. But if the matter be more <hi>hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned</hi> by the egreſs of tenuity, uniformly <hi>com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacted, white</hi> and <hi>lucid:</hi> take heed of that, caſt that away. If the parts be yet more <hi>pure</hi> and <hi>equall,</hi> hardend and made <hi>yellow</hi> by the celeſtiall ſpirit an intrinſecall inmate in the body wch is therby made moſt <hi>flexi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble</hi> by vertue of the <hi>ſimilar ſoftnes</hi> of the parts, and yet moſt <hi>ponderous</hi> of all mettals by the uniform <hi>cloſnes</hi> therof and the little <hi>poroſity</hi> by wch the air may enter to confer a levity; This is ſtark naught. It will not ruſt by the <hi>ſimilar purity</hi> of the parts, nor

            <p>With ſuch like prejudice do all our En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gliſh people take the <hi>Bible</hi> in their hands and read it: being adviced aforehand by their reformers and fully beleeving that the <hi>Catholik maſs</hi> is abomination, the <hi>reall pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence</hi> a chimera, the <hi>merit of good works</hi> a dream, <hi>faſting</hi> and all <hi>mortification</hi> of ſenſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all deſires a fardell of ſuperſtition, all en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour of <hi>fulfilling</hi> Gods precepts a vani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and the imagination of any <hi>poſſibility</hi>

            <p>And yet thus forewarnd and prepoſſeſt do all our <hi>reformed</hi> Chriſtians read the ſcriptures; no ſound or ſolid fruit ariſeing thence to their ſoules, but rather hardnes of heart, pride, ſchiſmes, fearlesneſſe of Gods judgments, and where good nature (the beſt religion I know in <hi>England</hi>) hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders not, deſperatenes in all ſin and inju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice.</p>

I muſt ſay more, he that goes out of the <hi>Church</hi> puts out his own eyes, and he that never enterd in, never had any but gropes in darknes. <hi>Light is come into the world</hi> ſaith our Lord, <hi>but men love darknes more than light, Jo.</hi> 1. namely, becauſe they ſhut their eyes againſt it; and no marvell that unto ſuch the <hi>Gospell ſhould be hid.</hi> Catholikes all of them have indeed the whole Goſpell <hi>by heart,</hi> and comprehendit ſufficiently for the <hi>life</hi> and <hi>ſpirit</hi> of it; yet ſtill the bark and <hi>letter</hi> of it hath obſcurity enough wch is opend and manifeſted as far as is needfull &amp; upon occaſion by the lips of prieſts wch preſerve knowledg. No man underſtands the mind of man but the <hi>ſpirit that is in man,</hi> nor the meaning of ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures can any comprehend but the <hi>ſpirit of that Catholik body</hi> whoſe the ſcriptures be. For theſe be imediatly the word and do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrin of the <hi>Church,</hi> and therfore called <hi>the Word of God,</hi> becauſe that Catholik body from whence it iſſued, is animated by the ſpirit of <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> her naturall head who is God bleſſed for ever, and the particular penmen therof being members of the ſayd
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:170217:52"/>church were peculiarly illuſtrated by that ſpirit unto ſuch an effect. So then the word of God is a <hi>light</hi> and enlightens good Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholiks, it enlightens not others that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main blinded in infidelity and ſeparated from that holy myſticall body of Chriſt: and yet tis a light ſtill, tis <hi>hid to them that are loſt.</hi>

            <p>People that live in a <hi>family</hi> colledg or corporation, by the daily ſight and <hi>practis</hi> of things to be don therin do fully compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend all that is to be ſaid or acted there. But others who be out of thoſe ſocietys ſhall never by <hi>bare reading</hi> of books writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten of ſuch emploiments, ſo long as them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves ſtay out, attain to any ſatisfactory light therof, but remain puſled in a wood of dark <hi>words,</hi> and either miſtake or not apprehend the reality and truth of things. So our people wthin the <hi>Church</hi> ſee di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinctly and clearly the truths of God, in whoſe <hi>practis</hi> they are daily converſant; ſo that words and writtings are not neceſſary unto ſuch as be in a continuall exerciſe of their trade; but <hi>ſectaries</hi> paymins &amp; al <hi>infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dels</hi> who be aliens and ſtrangers to this So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety &amp; out of the family; altho they ſhould look upon their book of ſtatutes ſcripturs
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:170217:53"/>or laws, yet will they ſtill be puſling about words and never clearly underſtand the ſecrets of the profeſſion. One artiſt or <hi>tradesman</hi> knows more <hi>by heart</hi> and pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſe, than the whole world beſides that is out of that body or not converſant in the <hi>ſociety</hi> can ever attain unto by reading. A man may demonſtrat by Philoſophicall reaſon, that <hi>light</hi> it ſelf enlightens not but by reflexion; no more do the <hi>word and ſcripturs</hi> except they reflect upon us from the boſom of the <hi>Catholik body</hi> wch actuats them in their operation.</p>
            <p>If you would ſeriouſly ponder theſe few words, you ſhould quickly perceive unto whom the ſcriptures be <hi>obſcure</hi> and unto whome they be <hi>eaſy;</hi> and how they be eaſy to <hi>Catholiks</hi> for the practiſe life and mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of them, tho the letter may ſtill keep its obſcurity: as children of a family may clearly underſtand all the whol affaires and buſineſſes of the houſe, tho if books ſhould be written therof they might not ſo eaſily underſtand the letter of thoſe books. Yet theſe have great advantage in the under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding of ſuch books abov thoſe who are not coverſant in the affairs being aliens and ſtrangers to the family. For tis eaſier
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:170217:53"/>by the <hi>knowledg</hi> &amp; perfect comprehenſion of <hi>things</hi> to underſtand words that be written of them; than by <hi>reading of words</hi> to perceiv things we are altogether unex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perienced in.</p>
            <p>But to ſpeak abſtractively of the <hi>letter</hi> of Scriptur wthout reference unto perſons: as if the caſe were that neither you nor I ever knew any thing of the Chriſtian <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion</hi> but what we get out of the <hi>Bible</hi> or new <hi>Testament</hi> put now into our hands. Could either of us or all of us together ſee clearly in this letter the whole ſtate of the <hi>Catholick Church?</hi> or without obſcurity diſcern wt is to be ſaid and done, wt is to be thought and beleevd, wt is to be hoped and feard; wt concerns God and his crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turs; wt angels and men; wt earth and hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven; wt our creation and redemption; wt the beginning and end of things. Firſt where is the order and method to find out theſe things. You will find that the ſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry and doctrinall part goes hand in hand together, wch is not the ordinary way of teaching. If I peruſe the ſtory of Goſpell by it ſelf, I ſhall ſcarcely find it anſwerable to my expectation whiles I find mention onely of one howr of <hi>Chriſts</hi> birth and not
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:170217:54"/>a word more for twelv years together, and then but one ſingle action of his appearing in the <hi>publick Schools,</hi> and not a word again of his whole life till almoſt twenty years after, and then onely ſome works he did in publick for the ſpace of about three years, &amp; ſo his death: wch is far leſs than I ſhould expect or deſire to know. And the <hi>do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine</hi> our Lord deliverd is no more of it ſet down, than what he ſpake incidentally in fields and ſtreets and publick places, the three years ſpace of his publik appearance, and not a word of any thing he taught his Schollers or Diſciples in particular, on ſet purpoſe (&amp; without reference to publick ſpeeches) which was without all doubt the main doctrin primarily intended both by the <hi>Maister</hi> &amp; his <hi>diſciples</hi> and moſt copi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly explicated. <hi>Moreover</hi> thoſe publick ſpeeches of or <hi>Lord</hi> we have ſet down in <hi>Gospell,</hi> they are deliverd us but under cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain generall heads and brief notes, wthout any order or connexion at all that can appear to any the ſubtilleſt wit that is. Our Lords <hi>Sermon</hi> on the mount is the largeſt piece of doctrin we hav of his deliverd at one time, (and moſt heavenly and divine it is like its authour) but he that reads the
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:170217:54"/>ſift, ſixt and ſeaven Chapters of S. <hi>Mathew,</hi> where tis ſet down, ſhall deſire connexion. And indeed the holy <hi>Evangoliſts</hi> colle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cting their <hi>Gospels</hi> as brief memorialls did it wthout all doubt the beſt way: And tis ſufficient, and far better than if all had been ſet down in that order and fulneſs of diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cours our <hi>Lord</hi> deliverd it. For the few ſeparated notions of <hi>Chriſtian</hi> morality ſet down in Goſpell wer enough to give teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony to the <hi>traditionall doctrine</hi> the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles had methodically received from their maſter for his Church. Finally thoſe ſpeeches of our <hi>Lord</hi> recorded in Goſpell be only ſome brief ſentences, and parables, queſtions and replies to interrogatories; wch be far ſhort to a whol body of divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, tho abundantly enough for a <hi>Church</hi> in whos bowels the <hi>Meſſias</hi> would imprint his law and intire will.</p>
            <p>It appears then both by the mingling of the <hi>ſtory</hi> and <hi>dogm</hi> together, by the few <hi>par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cells</hi> of the hiſtory it ſelf, by the want of that <hi>method</hi> and connexion in the dogma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticall part wch our dull capacities require for learning, and the <hi>omiſſion</hi> of great ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny things we ſhould need to be imformd in far more amply than we can find it ſet

But to others that be aliens and out of the <hi>Chu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ch</hi> it ſeems our <hi>Lord</hi> ſo orderd his ſpeech that they ſhould <hi>hear</hi> and yet not <hi>underſtand;</hi>
               <pb n="91" facs="tcp:170217:55"/>nor everfully perceiv his will till beleeving they were incorporated into his <hi>myſticall hody</hi> unto which alone all the myſteries of religion are delivered in perſpicuity and clearnes. This generall purpos and inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of penning the <hi>Gospell</hi> and other parts of the New Teſtament as ſhort manuall notes for Chriſtians within the Church or ſuch as are to be congregated unto it, from wch Churches hands they have both a lar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger <hi>explicit declaration</hi> of their faith and a full and ample practis thereof in her bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſom, muſt needs infer ſuch an <hi>obſcurity</hi> as ſhall obſtruct all poſſibility out of the Church of God by this bare <hi>letter</hi> ever to arrive to a clear underſtanding of the waies of <hi>Chriſtian Religion.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This is the firſt and great cauſe of that <hi>obſcurity</hi> ſcripture carries with it unto ſuch as come to ſeek their religion in a <hi>Book</hi> wch was never made to teach it, nor written for ſuch a propos. The churches <hi>doctrin</hi> as it comes out of her lips, that is the thing that <hi>converts</hi> nations and regenerats unto hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly life: and this <hi>written word</hi> is a good <hi>milk</hi> to nurs us up after we are rege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerated; wch made <hi>S.

<pb n="92" facs="tcp:170217:56"/>ſincere milk of the word that they may grow by it.</hi> 1. <hi>Pet.</hi> 2. But it is not the thing that givs us the firſt life. Indeed the <hi>Scriptur</hi> does little or no good, but as it is preſented by the <hi>Church,</hi> and received with her inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pretation, and practiſd in her boſom, wth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out wch three things I wil be bold to ſay it is not the <hi>Word of God,</hi> nor hath it any vertue at all. The <hi>Ark of God</hi> ſo long as it was upheld by the <hi>Prieſts</hi> it comforted and ſanctified them, but touched or lookt into by others it deſtroyd them; nor was it unto them an <hi>Ark of ſalvation</hi> but an offence and occaſion of fall.</p>
            <p>If we deſcend to particulars we ſhall eſpy reaſons enough of <hi>obſcurity,</hi> ſuch as will fruſtat all deſire of any perſpicuous diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very of <hi>faith</hi> to be made by any man wth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the <hi>churches</hi> help.

And the morall or <hi>dogmaticall part,</hi> tho it ſeem familiar yet hath it a profoundneſſe beyond all human writting. Indeed by this it is demonſtrated to be the <hi>Word of God</hi>
               <pb n="93" facs="tcp:170217:56"/>wch muſt needs be like himſelf, unſearch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able. <hi>Out of the abundance ef the heart the mouth ſpeaketh</hi> ſaith our Lord; and where the <hi>heart</hi> is immenſe the <hi>word</hi> is alſo incom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſible. I doubt not but there be too many amongſt our people in <hi>England</hi> who read the Scriptures as our boyes and girles do at ſchoole, judging the ſenſe compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hended as ſoone as the ſillables be ſpeld; I ſpeak not to ſuch.</p>
            <p>Greater divines to whome I ſpeak muſt and will acknowledg that the <hi>Scriptures</hi> be often <hi>argumentative,</hi> paſſing from one point to another wthout giving any do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrinall notice therof. This will make the reader hable to continuall <hi>miſtakes,</hi> whiles he conceivs the writer to go ſtill along upon the <hi>ſame ſubject,</hi> whereas he is paſt over to a new or a contrary one. As alſo in the <hi>Pſalmes, canticles</hi> &amp; <hi>Prophecies</hi> tis very familiar wth thoſe holy men under one &amp; the ſame <hi>number</hi> &amp; <hi>perſon</hi> to act themſelvs in one verſe, <hi>God</hi> or his <hi>church</hi> in the other imediately ſucceeding; in one half line to decipher <hi>things preſent,</hi> in the other con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>junctivly connext, <hi>things</hi> onely <hi>to come</hi> and not appliable to wt was then in hand tho the ſpeech be united. The good <hi>Eunuch</hi>
               <pb n="94" facs="tcp:170217:57"/>in the <hi>Acts of the Apoſtles</hi> was it ſeems ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viced hereof, when reading the Propheſy of <hi>Iſaias</hi> he asked <hi>Philip</hi> of whome doth the Prophet ſpeak this verſe <hi>(he was led as a ſheep to the ſlaughter.)</hi> of himſelf or of ſome other man, <hi>Act.</hi> 8.34.</p>
            <p>Again in the whole courſe of ſcriptur a man may meet wth <hi>propoſitions</hi> here and there deſperſt wch being taken apart from the other diſcours, and according to their own <hi>bare ſound</hi> are quite oppoſite to other formal aſſertions in the ſame book, nay to the very drift and intention of the <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thour;</hi> as will ſoon appear unto him that ſhall make an <hi>analyſis</hi> of the whole book: ſuch be the ſemiſentences, depraved texts and ill applied autorities uſed by <hi>ſectaries.</hi> For example in that ſublime and learned Epiſtle of <hi>S. Paul</hi> written to the <hi>Romans,</hi> our people of <hi>England</hi> do cull out many places for the ſoleſufficiencie of <hi>faith</hi> againſt the neceſſity &amp; merit of <hi>good works,</hi> wch is as far from the dift and intention of the <hi>Apoſtle</hi> as hell is from heaven, and unbeſeeming ſuch a <hi>Catholick doctour</hi> as <hi>S. Paul</hi> was, to write to ſuch a <hi>Catholik place</hi> as <hi>Rome.</hi> The buſines and occaſion of the letter was an emulation riſen in <hi>Rome</hi>
               <pb n="95" facs="tcp:170217:57"/>betweene the converted <hi>Jewes</hi> and the converted <hi>Gentiles;</hi> thoſe who had been made <hi>Chriſtians</hi> from <hi>Iewes</hi> diſabling the <hi>Gentiles,</hi> as being ever aliens from <hi>God,</hi> wheras the Iewes converted were firſt Gods ſervants under <hi>Moſes</hi> &amp; then under <hi>Chriſt,</hi> and ſo pleaſing God in the whole courſe of their linage by their good con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation according to the law they uſed: the <hi>Gentils</hi> on the other ſide diminiſht the <hi>Iewes,</hi> for that themſelves by the very light of reaſon doing wt they could was a <hi>law to themſelvs,</hi> and ſo far pleaſd God that he therfore brought them equally wth the <hi>Iewes</hi> unto the light of <hi>Goſpell</hi> wch the <hi>Iewes</hi> indeed deſervd not, ſith they had<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> murderd the <hi>Meſſias</hi> and <hi>Lord of glory.</hi> This childiſh <hi>emulation</hi> ariſing haply upon ſome ſlight word at their meetings pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded ſo far that it brake forth into open <hi>rancour</hi> one againſt another, inſomuch that their <hi>Prieſts</hi> and Paſtours who were amongſt them could not well allay it. Wherfore <hi>S. Paul</hi> notice therof being given to him wrote that letter of his to them, wherin he layes about him now at the <hi>Iewes,</hi> then at the <hi>Gentils</hi> confuting their pride and folly and giving them both
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:170217:58"/>to underſtand that neither of them had aught to boaſt of, ſith <hi>God of his free mercy</hi> had equally cald them both to the ſaving <hi>faith of Goſpell</hi> and made them <hi>Chriſtians:</hi> and therfore that they ſhould all live toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in humility peace and brotherly cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity. This is the ſcope and ſubject of that ſacred and moſt <hi>Catholik Epiſtle,</hi> ſo wretchedly abuſed by our pittifull <hi>Secta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries,</hi> who underſtanding nothing of the Apoſtles purpoſe <hi>deprave him as they do other ſcripturs to their own ruin.</hi> And tis an odde kind of riddle, that <hi>Catholik divines</hi> who do onely underſtand the ſcriptures ſhould affirm them to be <hi>hard</hi> and difficil to underſtand; <hi>heretiks</hi> who underſtand them not at all ſhould maintaine them to be <hi>eaſy.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Again we ſee that ſcriptur ever &amp; anon takes up <hi>figures, allegories</hi> and <hi>parables</hi> wherin are incloſed truths of a differing ſtrain to wt the <hi>letter</hi> relates.

And this cuſtom is it ſeems ſo fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent in <hi>Scriptur</hi> that the ſame <hi>Apoſtle</hi> gives a caution againſt too much adhereing to the bark and <hi>letter</hi> of ſacred ſcriptur, averring peremptorily that the <hi>letter kills, but the ſpirit</hi> or meaning couched under the letter, <hi>that is life,</hi> 2. <hi>Cor.</hi> 3. For that the <hi>bare letter</hi> of the hiſtory too much inſiſted upon will often lead if not to a <hi>contrary</hi> errour vet <hi>beſides</hi> the intended truth.</p>
            <p>Beſides, the ſame <hi>phraſe</hi> or <hi>letter</hi> is uſed in ſcriptur ſomtimes one way, ſomtimes another, as <hi>ſin</hi> (not to ſtand upon further exemplification) is taken commonly for an <hi>offens,</hi> and yet ſomtimes again for an <hi>expia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion therof,</hi> 2. <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.21. wth is almoſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary.</p>
            <p>Somthings in ſcriptur are ſpoken of <hi>God</hi> according to his <hi>eſſence,</hi> wch wthout good heed may prejudice the right beleef of a <hi>trinity:</hi> ſome things of <hi>Chriſt</hi> according to his <hi>humanity</hi> wch may d<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

            <p>Laſtly ſacred <hi>ſcriptur</hi> being a maſſe or body of writing both made up by ſeverall <hi>Authours,</hi> and a miſcellan of ſeverall kinds of words, <hi>hiſtories</hi> and <hi>lawes</hi> under a <hi>figure,</hi> hiſtories and lawes wth out <hi>figure</hi> or <hi>dog<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maticall, Propheſies</hi> of ſeverall ſtiles or phraſes, and all of them obſcure and para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bolicall, prudentiall <hi>Proverbs</hi> cloſe coucht together, and ſo antimetrically ſited that rare wits can ſearch into their depth; <hi>Pſalms</hi> and <hi>canticles</hi> ſo highly elevated above ordinary conceit, that for aught I ſee they may ſuffice to amuſe the under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtandings of all ages; <hi>parables</hi> not yet fully explicated; and dogmaticall <hi>Epiſtles</hi> of the good <hi>Apoſtles,</hi> wch if they be taken ſo far as may concern pure Chriſtianity wthout their economicall morall and politicall precepts (wch be eaſy and well enough known wthout them) are enough to exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe the underſtandings of mankind. <hi>Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures</hi> I ſay made up of all theſe ſeverall in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gredients argue firſt, that they were never
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:170217:59"/>pend to <hi>teach</hi> us our <hi>faith;</hi> but for a meer <hi>help</hi> of meditations, for exhortation &amp; in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citement of devotion and piety in people already beleeving. Secondly that it would be a loſt labour to go cull our beleef out of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, where no ſuch <hi>purpoſe</hi> is intended, no <hi>method</hi> uſed for it, and all kind of <hi>obſcuri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty</hi> contrary to ſuch an end.</p>
            <p>But to conclude; If Scriptur be indeed ſo <hi>clear</hi> and <hi>eaſy</hi> for each capacity to read, out of them to cull his faith and by them to frame his religion, as ſectaries pretend, and this be indeed the judgment of all <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formers;</hi> wherfore do they themſelves ſo multiply their <hi>catechiſts, interpretours</hi> and <hi>expoſitours</hi> theron? to wt end is all their <hi>preaching</hi> and weekly teaching? this if it be indeed to any end, muſt needs be either to expound <hi>faith,</hi> or promote good works; if the faith be <hi>clear</hi> enough, the expounding is in <hi>vain;</hi> as for <hi>good works</hi> they be long ago exploded &amp; banniſht out of the land, and the empty <hi>preaching</hi> for aught I know may go foot it after them: for words are in vain that tend to no end. In fine, whence comes all theſe <hi>diverſities of opinions</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gſt us here in <hi>England</hi> about matters of faith and religion, and ſo <hi>oppoſit</hi> one to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other?
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:170217:60"/>and yet all grounded upon <hi>Scriptur.</hi> Is that way ſo uniform and <hi>eaſy</hi> that leads men ſo <hi>diverſly?</hi> Nor am I ſatisfied at all in hearing ſom anſwer as they do, that this coms not of <hi>Scriptur</hi> but the diſorder and miſtakes of <hi>men:</hi> ſo lo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g as I ſee it may wth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the <hi>Churches</hi> help be ſo ſhreudly miſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken, I have reaſon to ſuſpect miſtakes <hi>in my ſelf</hi> too, if I once lean upon mine own ſpirit and induſtry as others do, being my ſelf no better than my neighbours. And therfore I am loth nay I ſhall never be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaded to leav the ſecure footing I now hav in all tranquillity peace &amp; uniformity wth the <hi>Catholik body</hi> of Gods Church, by the reſult of truth delivered us by antiqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty conſonant to Gods word both written and unwritten; and run my ſelf with the confuſd rout of diſagreeing ſectaries upon the <hi>rock of the Bible,</hi> ſo apt as it appears by the event to be miſ-underſtood and and wreſted awry, that I am clear of the opinion that no man out of the <hi>Church</hi> of God, nor nobody of mee<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> beſides the <hi>Church of God</hi> underſtands it right. Nor ſhall I be ſo mad now in my old age to go to dig my ſelf <hi>religion</hi> having ſo fair a one already ſtamped to my hands wch all the art of
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:170217:60"/>men and angels put together can never mend. Put him in <hi>Bedlam</hi> that undertakes both labour and hazard for naught.</p>

                  <hi>Madam</hi> you have now toucht upon the main buſines wherein all <hi>ſectaries</hi> be moſt pittifully deluded. If they do but go to Church and hear a Sermon, each one according to his fanſy, their duty is done and all his ſafe.</p>
            </sp>
            <p>I will not ſtand now to examine whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the <hi>preaching</hi> be <hi>orthodox</hi> or no. Be it what it will, It will not ſerv the turn.</p>
            <p>I have already to my ability declared that the <hi>reading of Scriptur</hi> is no ſufficient means of finding out our <hi>faith,</hi> tho ſo much as it is, it doth all of it confirm and verify the <hi>Churches doctrin.</hi> I ſhall now go for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward and evince two truths more. Firſt that <hi>reading</hi> or <hi>preaching</hi> of Gods word or the hearing therof (tho it be indeed Gods word and pure and orthodox) is not the <hi>eſſentiall</hi> or cardinal <hi>work</hi> of Chriſtian <hi>reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion.</hi> Secondly that a man may hear and read it all his life time and yet be loſt at the end both for want of grace and truth.</p>
            <p>Our Lord <hi>wrote</hi> nothing himſelf, as all men know, yet notwthſtanding he would
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:170217:61"/>never have failed either to have done it <hi>himſelf</hi> or commanded <hi>others</hi> to have done it, if <hi>reading</hi> or <hi>hearing</hi> had been the great work of his religion to be impoſed upon mankind. For <hi>reading</hi> you know, and <hi>ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounding</hi> of Scriptur preſuppoſes <hi>writing,</hi> and his great work had been no other than to ſee things <hi>written</hi> if our great work had been no other than to <hi>read</hi> or <hi>hear</hi> them. The four <hi>Evangeliſts</hi> afterwards put together ſome few heads of our B. <hi>ſaviours</hi> life and doctrin, haply to carry about wth them in their boſom, and entertain their converts wthall. But we do not read that our Lord gave them any <hi>command</hi> to do ſo. And this is an argument in your principles that he gave them none at all. And as he gave them no <hi>order</hi> to <hi>write,</hi> ſo neither did the promiſe them any <hi>aſſiſtance</hi> in their <hi>writing;</hi> for all the concurrence we find promiſed either them or their ſucceſſours, was onely for the <hi>pectorall cuſtody</hi> of their <hi>traditions orall doctrine</hi> and Church-<hi>go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment.</hi> And therfor ſince you deny the conſtancy of <hi>Chriſts</hi> aſſiſtance in the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuall <hi>government</hi> of his Church, internall <hi>beleef,</hi> and externall <hi>doctrin</hi> unto wch that aſſiſtance was promiſt, affirming that the
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:170217:62"/>
               <hi>Church</hi> of Chriſt as it is not in it ſelf infal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lible ſo hath it gone aſtray both in practis and doctrin; me thinks you might wth as much eaſe and indeed more plauſibility de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny the ſame concurrence to any of the Churches <hi>writings</hi> whereunto it was never promiſt at all, nor the <hi>Scriptur</hi> or writing it ſelf ſo much as <hi>commanded</hi> by him wthout whoſe order nothing of <hi>force or autority</hi> could be done.</p>
            <p>Nor it is to be thought but that <hi>Peter, James, Andrew,</hi> and others of the <hi>Apostles</hi> had been both as able and as willing to <hi>write Evangells</hi> as the other four, wherof two of them were but <hi>diſciples</hi> of a far in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feriour rank to the <hi>Apoſtles</hi> and indeed but companions and attendants upon them as may be ſeen in the Acts. Nay if writing had been ſuch a capitall work, <hi>S. Peter</hi> would never have neglected to have writ a Goſpell himſelf, eſpecially when <hi>S. Mark</hi> his pupil and companion wrote one. But this is an argument they had ſome greater work in hand and more nearly enjoind than that was. Nor can we find by any mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nument that any of the other ten <hi>Apoſtles</hi> who were ſent ſeverall waies for the worlds converſion carried any <hi>written Gospell</hi> at
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:170217:62"/>all wth them wch might be made by them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves; much leſs is it to be thought that they ſtaied to write out theirs, having their own breaſts ſo well fraught wth all that, and far more than they found ther <hi>written,</hi> eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally conſidering that two of the <hi>Evange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſts</hi> were but their pupills and diſciples. Nay before thoſe <hi>Gospels</hi> were written out and completed, eſpecially that of <hi>S. John,</hi> the <hi>Church of God</hi> was ſpread up and down the world and flouriſht in all the duties of Chriſtianity. By wch it may appear that even the <hi>written Gospell</hi> is neither it ſelf <hi>ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary</hi> to the <hi>being</hi> of the Church, nor the <hi>reading</hi> or expounding of a text the <hi>eſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiall work</hi> of Chriſtianity.</p>
            <p>As for the <hi>Epiſtles</hi> wch be the other part of the new Teſtament written by <hi>S. Paul</hi> and others. Theſe tis well enough known were pend a long while after the <hi>Church of God</hi> was perfectly formd and grown up in moſt parts of the known world; &amp; in particular after thoſe Churches of <hi>Rome, Corinth, Epheſus, Galatia, Theſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lonica</hi> and the reſt unto whom they are ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſt were <hi>perfected</hi> in all the eſſentialls of <hi>Chriſtian faith;</hi> and they were occaſiond merely <hi>accidentally</hi> upon the creeping in of
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:170217:63"/>ſome diſorders and errours in thoſe places contrary to the <hi>tradition of faith</hi> they had received, as may ſoon appear to him that reads and underſtands the tenour of thoſe <hi>spirituall Epiſtles.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>So then; the <hi>Church</hi> is antecedent to her <hi>Scriptur,</hi> and altogether independant ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on either for her being or profeſſion: helps of memory as all theſe <hi>writings be</hi> do pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuppoſe both the memory and the things to be remembred before thoſe helps were brought to light: And ſo, the <hi>reading</hi> of theſe <hi>Scriptures</hi> or hearing them expound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed can no wiſe be the <hi>eſſentiall work</hi> of Chriſtian religion or the <hi>totall exerciſe</hi> therof; but ſomthing that is altogether in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dependent of them, more ancient than they be, and that is more intrinſecally a wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, homage, adoration and ſervice of the <hi>moſt high God,</hi> than hearing or looking up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on words and ſyllables can be.</p>
            <p>I make no doubt but the whol <hi>Scriptur</hi> or writing of the <hi>new Teſtament,</hi> both Epiſtles and Goſpells was merely caſuall and <hi>acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dentall.</hi> For I find it long ago foretold by the <hi>Prophets</hi> that the law and government of the <hi>Meſſias</hi> ſhould in this differ from the Law of <hi>Moſes,</hi> that <hi>Moſes</hi> Law was all
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:170217:63"/>
               <hi>committed to paper</hi> but the doctrin of <hi>Ieſus</hi> ſhould be <hi>writ in the heart</hi> and entrailes of his Church. You may ſee one place in the Prophet <hi>Ieremy, c.</hi> 31.33. wch the Apoſtle in his Epiſtle, to the <hi>Hebrewes</hi> applies unto <hi>Christ</hi> our Lords dayes, <hi>Heb.</hi> 10.16. and S. <hi>Paul</hi> doth not obſcurely allude unto it in one of his letters he wrote to <hi>Corinth. c.</hi> 3.3. Indeed to <hi>imprint</hi> in the <hi>churches breaſt</hi> a law from wch ſhe ſhould never deviat, is in my judgment a greater argument of <hi>divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity</hi> than any written <hi>Goſpell</hi> could afford. The things wch <hi>Solon, Numa, Lycurgus, Draco,</hi> and other ſuch like men contrived and dictated for the good of their common wealths, did much commend their gravity, vigilance and wiſedome; and elevated them above <hi>other men,</hi> not above <hi>manhood. Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes</hi> himſelf the moſt profound &amp; judicious Lawmaker the world ever had, by the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellency of his written <hi>Laws</hi> hath merited the title of a divine and ſacred <hi>legiſlatour:</hi> but he is known to be a man by his <hi>hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>writing,</hi> and the <hi>paper</hi> he wrote on. He is a <hi>God</hi> that writes on the velin of the <hi>heart</hi> characters indelible unto eternity. The Law of Chriſt onely is written not <hi>wth ink but wth the ſpirit of the living God not in tables

            <p>I do alſo verily think, that the <hi>religion</hi> wch the Son of God deliverd to his <hi>church</hi> was neither commanded by him to be <hi>writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten;</hi> nor yet ever intended either by the <hi>Euangeliſts</hi> or other of thoſe primitiv wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters to be totally ſet down, under the no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of a <hi>rule of faith:</hi> altho ſo much as ther is of it, drawn principally for the uſe of <hi>devotion</hi> and charity, be a <hi>rule of faith</hi> alſo. What the occaſion might be that moved the four <hi>Euangeliſts</hi> to write their com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendious <hi>Goſpells,</hi> by the little learning I have I could never yet aſſuredly gather: altho I remember I have read ſomthing thereof in a learned latin book, made by a friend of mine called <hi>Syſtema fidei</hi> put forth ſome few years ago, wherein be very many things of excellent learning worthy of the Authour, but I have not now the book at hand. Wt occaſion moved <hi>S. Paul</hi> to write his Epiſtles unto <hi>Rome, Corinth</hi> and other places is manifeſt enough, and I ſhall after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward declare it, when I ſhall come to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover the <hi>religion of the Apoſtles and Euan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geliſts,</hi> and make it appear that they were all <hi>papiſts,</hi> and of the very ſelf ſame reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion Catholiks be of at this day.</p>
            <pb n="109" facs="tcp:170217:64"/>
            <p>All this put together; that <hi>Chriſt him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf</hi> neither <hi>wrote</hi> any thing nor comanded any thing to be <hi>written,</hi> yea gave notice that he would uſe his ſpeciall <hi>prerogative</hi> of legislatourſhip and <hi>write</hi> his law in <hi>hearts,</hi> promiſing to animate the <hi>body</hi> of his Church wth his own <hi>ſpirit</hi> wch ſhould <hi>lead them into all truth;</hi> and that the <hi>church</hi> was diſperſt over the earth before any Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian <hi>writting</hi> was made, wch was after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards drawn to confirm and ſtrengthen the faith and devotion it found already planted: All this being true, it follows ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parently that <hi>hearing</hi> or <hi>reading</hi> or <hi>prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching</hi> upon a text is not the great <hi>capitall work</hi> of Chriſtian Religion. Indeed tis childiſhnes to think that <hi>God</hi> unto whom all proſtration, adoration, all homage ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice and worſhip both of the outward &amp; inward man is more than due, ſhould be ſufficiently ſerved wth a little <hi>labour of the lips or ears</hi> when a man thinks good ſo to do.</p>
            <p>Preaching is indeed neceſſarily <hi>antece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent</hi> to Chriſtian faith; yet it onely <hi>diſpoſes</hi> unto furrher actions, as may eaſily appear both by autority of <hi>Scriptures,</hi> wch ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claime bitterly againſt ſuch as <hi>hear</hi> and go
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:170217:65"/>no further; and alſo by the very natur of <hi>hearing</hi> and all kind of exhortation wch ever tends to ſomthing beſides it ſelf. For who ever heard onely <hi>to hear</hi> and no fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther: who but our mad reformers ever <hi>preacht</hi> onely to be heard? And how can ſpeaking on one ſide and hearing on the other complete the whol duty of man to his <hi>God?</hi> as if one were nothing but <hi>tongue and ear,</hi> or had receivd nothing from him but thoſe two organs.</p>
            <p>Tell me <hi>Madam</hi> ingenuouſly: Do not you think you have ſufficiently done your duty to God, if you go but forth once a Sunday to <hi>hear a Sermon?</hi> and if you read a <hi>chapter</hi> or two in a week day, this is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing elſe in effect: altho by your favour you do not think you ſelf bound under ſin to either: but if you like the weather, or the parſon pleaſes, or your clothes be neat and handſom, then you will go forth to <hi>church,</hi> if not you will ſtay at home: if you find your ſelf diſpoſed in the week time to be godly, you read a chapter, if not you let it alone. And this is all you do or ever mean to do. And if your preacher do ſometimes upon occaſion exhort you to the <hi>abnegation</hi> of worldly deſires, to the
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:170217:65"/>
               <hi>castigation</hi> of your body by <hi>faſting</hi> and <hi>diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipline</hi> that you become not reprobate, to <hi>hoſpitality</hi> or almsdeeds, to a generall <hi>ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dication</hi> of all things for Chriſt by <hi>leaving father and mother wife and lands to follow him in</hi> that nakednes himſelf practiſed, finally to an univerſall <hi>conformity</hi> to the Son of God in piety and poverty. Theſe and ſuch like things he ſpeaks by cours and out of formality to make a plauſible noiſe in the Church and fulfill his houre. But he is not ſo mad as to think you will ever practiſe any of theſe things, nor do you hear him wth any ſuch purpos; the practiſe of ſuch things being well enough known by both of you or at leaſt beleeved to be down right <hi>popery</hi> by all reformations diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carded. His <hi>preaching</hi> is a talking to your eares, and your <hi>hearing</hi> a liſtning to his lips, till the ſound ceaſe, and then the <hi>eſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiall work</hi> of your religion is done. But if haply you like the wit of the preacher and give him your <hi>applaus,</hi> then you have both of you your finall expectation: and the whole work of <hi>religion</hi> both eſſentiall and accidentall is accompliſht.</p>
            <p>This kind of <hi>hearing</hi> and <hi>preaching</hi> ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to no further end is ſo far from being
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:170217:66"/>the ſole act <hi>religion</hi> that tis no religion at all; nay tis a mere <hi>mockery</hi> and abuſe of religion condemnd by the Scriptures both of the old and new <hi>Teſtament</hi> where tis concluded that <hi>not hearers but doers are ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtified.</hi>

               <p>Chriſtian <hi>preaching</hi> is of two ſorts. The firſt is abſolutly neceſſary, the other onely expedient. The firſt is made to <hi>Pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nims</hi> and ſuch as have not yet heard of Chriſt or reſpect him not as they ought, to <hi>convert</hi> them to his religion and faith; the other to <hi>Chriſtians,</hi> to put them in mind of the <hi>practis</hi> and end therof: the firſt is the <hi>parent</hi> and productiv power of <hi>faith,</hi> the
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:170217:66"/>ſecond a <hi>miſtres</hi> and overſeer of <hi>works.</hi> Of the firſt kind of <hi>peaching</hi> is often mention both in the <hi>Acts of the Apoſtles</hi> and other parts of the new Teſtament. For both in <hi>Goſpell</hi> when our ſaviour ſent out his Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles to <hi>preach</hi> unto all nations, and when they exerciſed this their miſſion in the <hi>Acts</hi> preaching before <hi>Iewes</hi> and <hi>Pagans,</hi> and when <hi>S. Paul</hi> in his Epiſtle to the <hi>Romans</hi> and elſwhere ſpeaks ſo much of <hi>preaching,</hi> tis every where meant of this preaching unto <hi>Gentils, Paynims</hi> and <hi>unbeleevers</hi> for their converſion. But concerning the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond kind of <hi>preaching</hi> made unto Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans ther is no news or mention at all ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of in the whole book of the <hi>Acts;</hi> nor did ever any of thoſe primitiv beleevers come together to hear a <hi>Sermon,</hi> but onely to <hi>ſupplication</hi> and <hi>prayer,</hi> and <hi>fraction of bread</hi> wch is the Catholik <hi>Maſſe.</hi>
               </p>
            </sp>
            <p>Indeed on the day of <hi>Pentecoſt</hi> after the Holy Ghoſt had viſibly deſcended upon the <hi>Catholik church</hi> congregated together in one place, and made them all ſpeak wth ſtrang tongues: Upon noiſe herof all ſorts of people both <hi>Iews</hi> and <hi>Gentils</hi> came floc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king in to behold the wonder, then <hi>S. Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi> took the occaſion to make a <hi>Sermon</hi> to
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:170217:67"/>thoſe ſtrangers who ſtood amaſed at the ſight, <hi>Act.</hi> 2. but that ſpeech was not di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected at all to the <hi>Chriſtians,</hi> as may ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear by the very matter and tenour therof; and all the <hi>Chriſtian ſervice</hi> was ended be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the people unto whom he addreſt his ſpeech came in. Nor for ſome hundred years after do we find or hear tell of any <hi>preaching</hi> made to Chriſtians; nor were they ever accuſed by the <hi>Roman</hi> prefects for other, than for meeting together and <hi>brea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king of bread;</hi> wheras <hi>Sermons</hi> if they had had any made, had afforded a more plauſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble accuſation againſt ſuch as already, tho wthout any deſert of theirs, bore the name of ſeditious.</p>
            <p>As ſoon as any perſon or nation had embraced his Chriſtian faith he then wth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out expecting further <hi>preaching</hi> fell pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently to thoſe <hi>works</hi> his faith dictated to him, and according to his obligation ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied himſelf to the rule he had received, as may be ſeen in the book of the <hi>Acts.</hi> And doubtles all prelats who had care of ſoules held forth unto beleevers that great dictamen of perfection and juſtice wch <hi>S. Paul</hi> calls <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>. <hi>We will</hi> and co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand <hi>that all who have once beleevd in God
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:170217:67"/>do make it their care to attend unto good works, Tit.</hi> 3.8. Tho indeed in after times when that firſt fervour of <hi>Chriſtian charity</hi> grew cold, and eſpecially upon times of ſingular mortification and faſts, as in <hi>Lent</hi> and <hi>Advent,</hi> as alſo upon high ſolemnitys, the Catholik Church hath ever made uſe of this <hi>ſecondary preaching</hi> wch is made unto Chriſtians for the incitement of <hi>works</hi> of piety. This ſecondary <hi>peaching</hi> is indeed a religious exerciſe &amp; profitable to diſtreſt and ſlack ſpirits for comfort and advice. But no good <hi>Chriſtian</hi> ever lookt upon it as the <hi>great work</hi> of his religion or ever thought his duty to be don when the <hi>Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon</hi> was ended.</p>
            <p>In a word, the Catholik church uſes both theſe kinds of <hi>preaching,</hi> the one to infidels for their converſion, the other to Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans for their exhortation. But ſhe places the ſum of her <hi>religion</hi> in neither of them; but in the performance of thoſe things wherunto people are <hi>converted</hi> and <hi>ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horted.</hi> And a third kind of <hi>preaching</hi> wch is to no further end at all, but onely to ſpend time, was never thought of by <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians</hi> till this wretched <hi>hereſy</hi> invented it. For your <hi>preaching</hi> is not Mr <hi>Parſon</hi> to
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:170217:68"/>
               <hi>convert</hi> your auditours, who have already received their faith and be as good Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians as your ſelf, nor yet to <hi>excite</hi> them to <hi>good works</hi> wch be in both your judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments juſtly caſherd long ago as <hi>popiſh.</hi> But your preacher, he preaches till for his livelihood he has <hi>ſtood</hi> his howr, and the hearers hear till they have ſat their hour, and then all haſten home and the work of God is ended. This is all your holocauſt, an ear-offering: and he that wants his ears, or has them ſtopt by cold may ſtay at home as unfit for ſervice.</p>
            <p>In my judgement tis pure non ſens and no religion at all to be ſtill <hi>preaching faith</hi> as reformers do unto people wch already underſtand their faith as well as their tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chers, or think they do at leaſt: and if they chance for formalitys ſake to fall upon any <hi>practicall point</hi> to ſpeak therof wth no pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos, hope or intention of their practiſe. For tis agreed on both ſides, both preacher &amp; people that ſuch practis is <hi>popery,</hi> and no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing requiſit to ſalvation but onely to beleeve.</p>
            <p>Hear a parable. Two <hi>artificers</hi> had each of them an <hi>apprentis.</hi> The firſt having de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered to his ſervant exactly all the rules
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:170217:68"/>of his art, put him preſently to work and practis by them, aſſuring him that <hi>practis</hi> will better his <hi>knowledg,</hi> wch the ſervant in all ſinglneſſe of heart applying himſelf to labour according to the dictats of his rule advanced accordingly, and ſo became emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent in the eyes of men, and excceedingly beneficiall to the common wealth. The other <hi>tradesman</hi> wth drew from the ſight of his prentiſe all the particular rules and whole method of his art, &amp; onely deliverd unto him in groſſe ſom experiments and feats thereof, by wch notwthſtanding he could not perceiv at all either where to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin or how to go on; nay he gave his ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant one generall caution, <hi>not to put his hands to any thing,</hi> his duty being onely once a week to com and ſit down before him, and hear him diſcours of the uſefulnes and benefit of his trade: <hi>Onely beleeving</hi> in him his work is ended. The prentiſe un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der ſuch a teacher grew to be a great <hi>pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient in works</hi> and ſentences, but never put his hand to any thing either for his own credit or the benefit and ſervice of mankind. Nay he mockt at the other ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prentis and cald him ſimple drudg. The firſt of theſe artificers is the <hi>Catholik
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:170217:69"/>church,</hi> the other is the <hi>Reformation.</hi> Do you apply the reſt.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Catholik Religion</hi> is a noble, a ratio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal religion, well beſeeming a complete man to profeſs, well beſeeming the Son of God to plant. The <hi>reformation</hi> a vain emp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty buſineſſe, befitting none to receive it but a company of cripples, that have nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther hands nor feet to uſe; nor none to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent it but dawes and magpies. It begins in <hi>teaching</hi> and ends in <hi>preaching. Wo to you Phariſees</hi> ſaith our Lord <hi>for ye tith mint and rue and all manner of herbs, and paſſe over judgment and juſtice and the love of God<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> thoſe ye ought to have done, and not leave the other undone, Luc.</hi> 11. Preaching if it be right and pious may be uſed; nay, when in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructions, adviſe and comfort is neceſſari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to be applied, it ought to be <hi>done:</hi> but the practiſe wherunton it tends, this is not to be left <hi>undon.</hi> The tithing of <hi>mint, rue</hi> and <hi>cumin</hi> does but figur out under a tipe a conſecrating unto God part of the good things we do enjoy from him, by <hi>faſting almsdeeds</hi> and <hi>prayer:</hi> that is to be <hi>done,</hi> theſe not to be left <hi>undone. Preaching</hi> puts in mind of the <hi>works</hi> of faith hope and charity: that wher is need, is to bee <hi>uſed,</hi>
               <pb n="119" facs="tcp:170217:69"/>theſe not to be <hi>neglected.</hi> At one and the ſame time to <hi>preach</hi> good things in the pul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pet, and to cry down the ſame things by the rules of <hi>Reformation</hi> is to <hi>open</hi> a mans mouth and <hi>ſtop</hi> his wind pipe. All your people go to your Churches wth ſuch a prejudice againſt the cuſtoms of <hi>Catholik Church,</hi> whence they are cut off by the <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation,</hi> that altho the miniſter ſhould chance wth ſingular zeal and eloquence to declaim againſt <hi>ſin,</hi> and cry up the <hi>exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſes</hi> of Chriſtianity; yet the auditory is promoted nothing at all therby, being aforehand prejudiced by the rules of <hi>refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation</hi> incorporated and naturaliſed in their ſpirit. For who can take ſuch words to heart, or ever heed them effectually, that ſhall firmly beleev that <hi>all we do or can do is ſin,</hi> and wt ſin ſoever we commit, we ſhall ſure enough be ſaved if we do but <hi>be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leev in Christ.</hi> People imbued wth theſe principles ſhall never by any <hi>Rhetorick</hi> ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of man or angel, be either affrighted from evill, <hi>wordly pleaſures</hi> and ſin; or perſwaded to the laborious works of <hi>mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tification</hi> and pennance. The ſowr grapes of <hi>Reformation</hi> have ſo ſet peoples teeth on edg, that they cannot chew good mear. Tis
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:170217:70"/>in vain, tis utterly in vain to <hi>bid dead men walk,</hi> or exhort thoſe to the works of life who by the poyſon of reformation are made dead and ſenſles. <hi>Preaching</hi> is to Catholiks a profitable and <hi>religious exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe;</hi> to hereticks if it be orthodox tis a <hi>vain work,</hi> if pſeudodox tis a <hi>wicked work:</hi> but to no people nor in no kind is it or can it be the onely work or ſole Chriſtian duty.</p>

            <p>To ſpeak more particularly; the works
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:170217:70"/>wch Catholiks by their faith are directed and exhorted unto be of two ſorts, <hi>perſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall</hi> and <hi>conventuall.</hi> The <hi>perſonal</hi> works be firſt, a conſtant <hi>obedience</hi> to the Church in all her dictamens of faith: upon this great hinge hangs indeed all true and ſolid Chriſtianity: then an effectuall exerciſe of homage and <hi>piety</hi> to God, of <hi>juſtice</hi> and charity towards our neighbour, of <hi>ſobriety</hi> and continence in our ſelves. Theſe things muſt be done: he that does them beſt ſhall fare beſt for it. The <hi>conventuall,</hi> a reverent uſe of Sacraments, and a preſence at divine pſalmody and Sermons, according to our occaſion and need.</p>
            <p>But the great capitall conventuall work and worſhip is the venerable and bleſſed <hi>Sacrifice of the Altar,</hi> every holiday ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemnly exhibited; &amp; every Chriſtian ſtands obliged to be then preſent at it: tho his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>votion may find it each day of the week in our <hi>Catholik churches;</hi> and many thouſands of good people ſerv God every day in this holy rite. But this is a free offering of their own not wthout great benefit and comfort to themſelvs, unto wch <hi>Holy church</hi> will not oblige.</p>
            <p>This is that <hi>great work</hi> wch conſtitutes
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:170217:71"/>and eſſentiates Chriſtian Religion. By this it was perfected in its fundamentall wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip and duty towards God long before our people had any <hi>Scripturs</hi> to read; and by wch, eſpecially ſeconded wth its other Catholik appurtenancies, it would ſtill re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main intire altho there were no <hi>Scriptures</hi> at all either to read or hear. For Scriptur as it is expounded by Holy church, or ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the <hi>traditional doctrin</hi> of the church, whereof Scripture is a ſhort and compen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dious coppy, is to us Chriſtians a light, not to ſit idle by, but to work by.</p>
            <p>This is the <hi>work</hi> wch the Diſciples and Apoſtles fell upon imediately after the aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cenſion of our Lord according as he had taught them to do at his paſſion: where by word and action ſhowing his Apoſtles the manner of that great work he added his charg, <hi>Hoc facite, This do ye.</hi> For ſaith holy text. <hi>Then returned they from Jeruſalem, and when they wer com into an upper room, they all continued wth one accord in prayer and ſupplication wth the women and Mary the mother of Jeſus.</hi> Act. 1.12. The great work here was bowing of knees not ſquat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting down in a pew, ſupplication not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hortation, praying not ſermoning. And the
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:170217:71"/>ſweet penman of that ſtory ſpeaking of the preſence of the other ſex, out of his peculi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ar devotion expreſt by name <hi>Mary the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of Jeſus</hi> who wth her preſence graced the firſt <hi>high maſs</hi> of the Church in all an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gelicall purity. And the church ſince that time had never high maſs without her. The ſacred text inſinuats that this great work held them no ſmall time together, by ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that they continued wth one accord therin. Tis likely they were conſtant and daily at it all the ten dayes between <hi>Aſcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion</hi> and <hi>Pentecoſt,</hi> for they were comanded <hi>to keep together till they were endued wth power from on high, Luc.</hi> 24.49.</p>
            <p>And in ſom one of thoſe dayes, (proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly after the ſacred ceremony was ended) <hi>S. Peter</hi> ſtood up and propounded to the <hi>body of the church</hi> an election of ſome one in place of <hi>Iudas,</hi> that the ſacred hierarchy might be made up againſt <hi>Pentecoſt,</hi> when the holy <hi>Ghoſt</hi> was to deſcend upon them: when indeed he did deſcend upon them all, united wth one accord in the ſame exerciſe. <hi>S. Peter</hi> declareing and defending the no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velty of that ſtrang infuſion, to ſuch <hi>Iews</hi> and <hi>Gentils</hi> as came running in amongſt them at the noys therof. And as before

            <p>This <hi>ſacred Action</hi> and venerable ſervice of God was by the <hi>first Chriſtians</hi> named <hi>Miſſah,</hi> a notion they had out of the <hi>old Teſtament,</hi> where the Sacrifice of the <hi>Meſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſias</hi> peculiar onely to his people and reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion by way of conſtitution &amp; diſtinction from all others, is ſo named: and the <hi>La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tin</hi> and weſtern part of the church did ever keep the name as well agreeing to the La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tin tongue.

               <hi>breaking of bread.</hi> The primitiv
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:170217:75"/>Chriſtians gave it ſeverall names, the <hi>Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charist, the Synaxy,</hi> the <hi>Dominicum,</hi> and the like, changing the word as ſouldiers do the <hi>watchword,</hi> that uncircumciſed pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nims ſhould not know wt they meant; as our <hi>Catholiks</hi> now in England uſe ſome by-expreſſions therof for concealment. And the <hi>antient doctours</hi> of the church wrote very cautiouſly of it, eſpecially in ſuch books as they thought might haply fall into the hands of <hi>pagans</hi> as may be ſeen in ſeverall places of <hi>Origen, S. Austin</hi> and others. I obſerved the laſt time I read over <hi>S. Auſtin de civitate Dei</hi> a very no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table paſſage to this purpoſe (tho I have not now the book to turn to it) where ſpeaking accidentally of the <hi>venerable bread</hi> of Chriſtians he preſently recalls himſelf ſaying, they <hi>know wt I mean whoſe bread this is</hi> and in whoſe cauſe I write. And a certain Roman prelat in antient times denied to ſend by writing an anſwer of ſom doubts propounded by ultra-marin Chriſtians concerning ſome circunſtances of the <hi>maſs,</hi> leaſt the <hi>pagans</hi> intercepting his letters ſhould therby diſcover the <hi>my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtery</hi> of Chriſtian Religion; but he promiſt to ſend a meſſenger to the petitioners, who
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:170217:76"/>ſhould inform them by word of mouth. So carfull they were not to caſt <hi>this pearl before ſwine.</hi> Yet as ſoon as <hi>Paganiſm</hi> was ſubdued, their writings came abroad copiouſly, and gave ample teſtimonies therof. <hi>S. Ambroſe</hi> was in the third age of the <hi>church,</hi> and yet he began to be bold, and writ not onely of the ſubſtance of the thing, but betrayed the very name, wherby it was generally known and called, namely <hi>miſſa</hi> or <hi>maſs.</hi> But they all frequently ſpake of the <hi>Altar,</hi> and <hi>Prieſts,</hi> the <hi>Sacrifice</hi> and <hi>ſervice</hi> of the moſt high God per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formd in Chriſtian Religion, and the like. And the writers of the laſt twelv hundred years ſpeak ſo amply and ſo plainly therof, that the very citation of their evidences would fill a volume.</p>
            <p>For this divine ſervice were all our <hi>churches</hi> in England erected by Catholiks in the form of a <hi>croſs:</hi> the <hi>high Altar</hi> now called the Chancell being placed in the head of the church, and the <hi>Tabernacle</hi> over it for the body of our Lord to repoſe on for Chriſtian mens ſolace, wth <hi>candles</hi> and <hi>lamps</hi> before it; below it was the <hi>quire</hi> for the clargy, to ſing prayſes night and day before their redeemer: on both ſides
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:170217:76"/>of the church, <hi>leſſer Altars</hi> for other prieſts to celebrate in at their devotion; and the <hi>nave</hi> or body of the church kept clenly and vacant for the people to kneel in, &amp; con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue wth one accord in their ſupplication and prayer, according as it is written, <hi>My hous is the hous of prayer.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>If churches had been onely buylt for <hi>preaching</hi> and <hi>hearing Sermons</hi> they would not have been made in the <hi>form of a croſs</hi> as they be, but of a <hi>theater</hi> or <hi>amphitheater</hi> rather, wth ſcaffolds about for that pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, and ſuch ſtalls or pews below as now all our churches are peſterd wth, in Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lik times utterly unknown.</p>
            <p>And if a man look into the <hi>places of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>votion</hi> the Chriſtians reſorted unto in times of <hi>paganiſm</hi> before they had any churches erected, wch were for the moſt part in dens and caves &amp; bottoms of mountains (wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of many are ſtill to be found in all King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms of Europ) he ſhall eaſily diſcern what their <hi>buſines</hi> was there. I once ſaw one of them in a hill neare <hi>Paris</hi> cald mount <hi>Dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>martin</hi> wch deſcended as I remember three ſcore ſteps into the hill; at the bottom there is a place, of the bignes of a chamber, and an <hi>Altar ſtone</hi> at the head of it in part
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:170217:77"/>ſtill remaining, and a hole in the ſame rock over the Altar for the <hi>Prieſts chalice</hi> to ſtand in. And generally, wher ever ſuch places are found, ther is either an <hi>entire Altar ſtone,</hi> or ſome remnants or ſignes of it.</p>
            <p>This <hi>ſacred Synaxy</hi> was the only thing that brought Chriſtians together in times of hotteſt perſecution, at wch moſt of our <hi>Chriſtian Martirs</hi> were taken. And yet notwthſtanding others could not forbear; for that they could not have that comfort any other way nor yet were they able to live wthout it: As appears in the <hi>Acts</hi> and proceſſe of our ancient Martirs; particular<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the <hi>proconſulary Acts of S. Saturnin.</hi> Wher we read that when the pagan empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours had given a comand that no Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian ſhould dare to be preſent any more at their <hi>Maſs,</hi> wch the Chriſtians at that time called their <hi>Dominicum,</hi> the martirs replied <hi>ſine Dominico eſſe non poſſumus, we cannot live wthout Maſs.</hi> And therfore <hi>S. Saturnin</hi> being askt by <hi>Analin</hi> the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſul whether he had been at Maſs he an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered <hi>Chriſtianus ſum</hi> as if he had ſaid being as I am a Chriſtian I cannot do otherwiſe; tis <hi>Chriſtianity,</hi> tis my very <hi>life</hi>
               <pb n="135" facs="tcp:170217:77"/>and <hi>being.</hi> If all the Religion of thoſe an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient Chriſtians had been onely a little <hi>bea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring</hi> or <hi>reading,</hi> and their onely work to <hi>beleev in Chriſt;</hi> they had never needed to expoſe their lives for that: for <hi>Reformers</hi> do not think themſelvs bound under ſin to hear any body; ſith they beleev already, wch is all that is neceſſary to ſalvation. We cannot live wthout <hi>abſolution</hi> and <hi>Maſs,</hi> they may live wthout a <hi>pratling preacher</hi> wch moſt of them do but cenſur; and none of them be advanced by him either in their faith or good works: onely their ear is ſomtime tickled a little wth a witty actour in the pulpet; as there be indeed ſom of them ſo ingenious, that tis as much pleaſur to hear them ſpeak as <hi>Ben. Iohnſons Catilin</hi> or <hi>Sejanus.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>By all this diſcours I would infer that <hi>hearing</hi> or <hi>preaching the word</hi> is not the ſole act of Chriſtian Religion; nor yet the main and principal act therof: ſith of its own natur it is but a <hi>preparativ</hi> and diſpoſition to ſome further work; and the <hi>diſpoſition</hi> is ever les noble than the <hi>form</hi> it diſpoſes unto. And if it diſpos unto no other thing, as <hi>Reformers preaching</hi> does not, then is in no Religion at all but a meer mockery. This was my firſt theſis.</p>
            <pb n="136" facs="tcp:170217:78"/>
            <p>My other was, that a man may all his life time either read or hear the word and yet at length be undon both for his ſin and infidelity, if in any one thing he misbeleev or fail.</p>

Your <hi>Popes</hi> themſelvs tho I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fes they have been many of them very holy and learned perſonages, yet ſom of them hav been known to be as bad as the worſt; and yet even thes have been as Zealous of the integrity of their faith as the greateſt Saints; and would ſooner <hi>do ill,</hi> than <hi>ſay</hi> it might be <hi>done.</hi> Simony, Pride, Gluttony, known and acknowledgd ſins theſe ſome of them would act of their own accord; but all the power of earth ſummond together ſhould not force any of them to abrogat one article of their <hi>faith</hi> or traditions, though it were but the ſprinckling of holy water. I read not long ago in an authen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick ſtory, that the nobls and Prelats of England perceiving the reſolution &amp; rage
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:170217:81"/>of K. <hi>Harry</hi> upon the forementiond af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>front, certified the <hi>Pope</hi> by a privat Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſſadour, that if he did not ſome what re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent, and condeſcend to the Kings deſires, the whole frame of Catholik Religion in England wch already crackt would be ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly overthrown, the nobility diſgraced, monaſterys ruind, Byſhops depoſed, thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſands impriſond, and perhaps martyrd, and the whole land undon. To wch the <hi>pope</hi> replied, (frantick man as he was) though the whole body of Chriſts church ſhould be deſtroyed, yea tho heaven and earth ſhould mingle together in its old Chaos of confuſion, yet would he not declare that lawfull wch in conſcience he thought was not ſo. What a crabbed perverſneſſe was this. He was certainly no Gentleman S<hi rend="sup">•</hi> Harry, that would not be perſwaded, tho heaven and earth ſhould come together, to chang his judgment.</p>

               <p>To be obſtinat and heady in our own <hi>proper opinions</hi> is oftimes unſeaſonabl and unhandſom.

<pb n="144" facs="tcp:170217:82"/>judgments) and therfor in al honeſty to be preſerved entire by the truſtee of our Lord, who committed it unto his church wth this caution that not one <hi>jota</hi> or <hi>apex</hi> therof ſhould be altered. And therfore that <hi>Pope</hi> who would not declare againſt his conſcience, although heaven and earth ſhould com together, did no more than what his Lord and Maiſter had ſaid before him. <hi>Heaven and earth ſhall paſs away, my word ſhall not paſs not one jota orapex therof,</hi> Luc. 21. And it was a doubl madnes in <hi>Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry the eigth,</hi> doing himſelf evil to expect the church of God ſhould ſay it was good. Nor be there <hi>Madam</hi> in Faith any ſuperfluous parts, but the whole body of it hangs ſo co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>catenated and cemented together, that the taking away of any one particl would ruin the whole fabrick; nor will you find in faith any portion leſs ſtrong than another, but al equally invincible: Som may be more leading points, wherupon others depend, and more materiall in their quality; but in reſpect of our beleef the leaſt hath as much firmnes of truth as the greateſt. And wt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever ſophiſtry may ſeem to ſhake any one, apply the like engin to any other and in ſhall do as much: that is to ſay, in very

Wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore <hi>Madam</hi> bereaving me of any of my faith you rob me of all; for it is an uncon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troulable rule in faith what the Apoſtle alſo does as in a good ſenſe it may be ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied unto manners. <hi>Qui delinquit in un<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

            </sp>
            <p>This you would eaſily underſtand if you would conſider how we receivd our faith and Chriſtian doctrin. For it was all equally handed to us at once, and that from the autority of one and the ſame originall; and it was extant in the world before any Scriptures were pend. And theſe ſacred Scripturs, and other pious Books, and alſo all generall councells that hav ever been celebrated in the Church were formed af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards, directed, ſwayed, rectified, and ordered by this rule of Traditional doctrin committed to the <hi>Church</hi> and kept by her. So that iſſuing conformably from one and the ſame ſours, all points of faith have an equall proportion of truth, however they may differ in their own materiall weight. The intrinſecall valiew of ſome articles may infer more of neceſſity and obligation
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:170217:83"/>to an explicit beleef and practis, but the leaſt and ſmalleſt points do wth as much right as the greateſt exclude a poſitiv miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beleef. I am not bound to know or practis all things of the churches doctrin, but I am bound not to diſallow condemn or reject any of her traditionall Chriſtianity has been equally handed from age to age unto us. He that formally rejects any thing of this as fals, doth vertually deny all the reſt; ſith one and the ſame veracity deliverd all. No mans privat reaſon invented any part of my beleef, and therfor no mans reaſon can reject it. Nay the higheſt points ar of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times moſt contingent, and conſequently the leaſt capable of a proof, as Gods in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carnation, paſſion, and reſurrection: and if mans conceits be once permitted to inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medle &amp; determin of the leſſer or greater probability of points, and caſt away at his pleaſur what himſelf thinks unlikly, he will undoutedly go on from one negation to another, till all be overthrown.</p>
            <p>It may chance, that in diſcourſing I may ſay ſomtime that all the articles of our Catholik faith be taken out of Scriptur wherin they be implicitly contained: But in this I do but ſpeak wth the vulgar and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:170217:83"/>to the capacity of hearers; and tis indeed true in this ſens, for that all Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lik beleef is conformable to thoſe ſacred writings. But in very truth (to ſpeak with wiſe men as well as we do think and ever ſhall beleev wth them) the Scripturs them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelvs (thoſe I mean principally wch make up the new Teſtament) were drawn by the rule of our traditionall doctrin &amp; explicit faith, and not our explicit faith gathered out of them.</p>
            <p>This may appear by part of my former diſcours, wherein I declared that the pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of Scripturs was meer accidentall and caſuall; and that all our traditionall faith was more ancient than Scriptur, and alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether independent of it; So that Scriptur and tradition go indeed hand in hand to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether as a joint rule of faith; yet ſo, as that Scriptur gives tradition the right hand as being its elder and judg of it ſelf, aswell as as cojudg wth it of all other doctrins. For both Goſpells and Epiſtles written in A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles name were ſo far approved or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected by the Church (however they came equally armed wth Apoſtolicall names pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fixt before them) as they were found con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonant or diſſonant to the churches tradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:170217:84"/>For ther were more Goſpells writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten than the four we hav, and far more E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſtles than thos the church admitted to her cannon.</p>
            <p>And this is the reaſon: why the Apoſtles themſelvs and Diſciples met together, to try whether the preachings and writings of all their miſſionaries were punctually con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formable to the tradition they had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived; from wch meeting <hi>S. Paul</hi> himſelf (though <hi>an Apoſtle not of men, neither by man but by Jeſus Chriſt and God the Father,</hi> Gal. 1.1.) Yet would he not be exempted from that meeting. <hi>After three years</hi> ſaith he, <hi>I went up to Jeruſalem to ſee Peter and abode wth him fifteen dayes,</hi> Gal. 1.18. <hi>Then fourteen years after I went up again to Jeru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſalem wth Barnabas and took Titus wth me alſo. And I went up by revelation, and comu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicated unto them that Gospell wch I preach among the Gentiles, but privatly to them</hi> wch <hi>wer of reputation, least by any means I ſhould run or had run in vain,</hi> Gal. 2.1.2. By <hi>wch</hi> I think it may be gathered that the <hi>church</hi> is above the <hi>Scriptur</hi> and of greater auto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity than either <hi>Paul</hi> or <hi>Barnabas</hi> or any wtſoever ſingle man and member of the Church, ſith ſhe judges every ones doctrin,
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:170217:84"/>to the approbation or rejection of it: For a judg is more noble than the thing wch is <hi>ſubject</hi> to his cenſur, the <hi>rule</hi> than the thing examined and <hi>ruled</hi> by it, and to <hi>giv</hi> an ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probation is in that formality more excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent than to <hi>receiv</hi> it.</p>
            <p>Neither was ever any generall councell cald together to teach the church her do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrin. But upon the riſing of hereſys, judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing by the rule of their tradition the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lats in councell confirmd the Catholiks in the way they found them in, and declared againſt hereticall innovations that they might deſiſt from further commotion.</p>
            <p>This <hi>rule of tradition</hi> found in the hands &amp; practis of Chriſtians diſperſt over the earth, left them by their forfathers, could not fail ſo long as it was found univerſally agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in the whole Catholik body wch is animated by <hi>the spirit</hi> of infallibility: eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially being ſtrengthened by teſtimony of Apoſtolicall writings wch were nothing but a part of the churches <hi>tradition</hi> coppied out, or the fathers that ſucceeded them, or other monuments that were yet remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing amongſt them. As for example the Chriſtians found an injunction of praying for the dead upon the very wals, windows,
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:170217:85"/>gravſtones and monuments of their decea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed forfathers, commended alſo unto them both by teachers, their living books, and by books, their dead teachers; and all children found their parents in the beleef and pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice of it: And therfor it was concluded that it could be no other than as it was the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> eſteemd an article of pure Chriſtianity; ſith the whol body of Chriſtians then pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent held it ſo, their forgoers and fathers deliverd it, ſacred Scriptures ſufficiently in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſinuated it, Catholik writings and monu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments confirmd and comended it unto them.</p>
            <p>So that <hi>Madam</hi> that piece of <hi>popery</hi> you would take from me, being a part of this <hi>Catholik tradition,</hi> will be as hardly wreſted from me as the <hi>Goſpell</hi> it ſelfe, wch the ſame <hi>tradition</hi> has deliverd as a coppy conform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able for ſo much as it is, unto it ſelfe the <hi>firſt and univerſall rule of faith;</hi> by wch pape himſelfe and all generall councells are guided, &amp; ſo ſubject unto it that they can act nothing againſt it: as may appear by the proceedings of the Catholik church from its very firſt birth and upriſing unto this preſent day. Pope <hi>Iohn the</hi> 22<hi rend="sup">d</hi>. a lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned man, &amp; much given to reading found
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:170217:85"/>in many places of the Greek and Latin fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, as alſo in texts of ſacred Scriptur, as he conceived, that the ſouls of Chriſtians deceaſed went releaſed out of purgatory thence into ſome place of repoſe on this ſide heaven and eternall bliſs, where they expected the conſummation of their num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber; that all the Catholik body might at the end of the world enter paradis together. This opinion by the multitud of autoritys and arguments appeard unto him ſo pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable, that he ſent it to ſome Chriſtian Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſitys, to have their judgment, if that were not indeed Chriſtian beleef. But they roſe up againſt it, and rejected it as diſſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant to tradition. For the Pape, tho he be Overſeer of the whole church, yet being but one ſingle man he cannot of himſelf diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern the univerſality of a tradition ſo well as the whole Catholik body may do, and therfor he never defines faith but with that Body conciliarly aſſembled: and if himſelf ith interim ſhould light upon an opinion, how probable ſoever it may ſeem by hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man arguments yet muſt he himſelf as well as other Chriſtians lay it aſide if it be confronted by <hi>Catholik tradition</hi> the great and unreſiſtable Rule of Chriſtianity, &amp; re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:170217:86"/>himſelf. And it ſeems a principle of faith had delivered unto Chriſtians this be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leef, that <hi>a ſoul once expiated goes to heaven.</hi> Pope <hi>John</hi> tho he had reaſon to ſuſpect ſo much, ſo that he might hav abſtained from propounding his theſis: yet he did not propound it in councels where faith is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined, but in Schools wher opinions are diſputed, and diſtinguiſht from faith; and upon that account was he juſtly to be excuſed. Yet was that good Prelat ſo ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der conſcienced, that he is ſaid to have askt the world forgivenes at his death, if they took any offence therat; adding wthal that he did it only to give them occaſion to ſearch more narrowly whether the opinion were not conſonant to tradition, although it had not been yet heeded.</p>
            <p>If then neither <hi>Pape</hi> nor <hi>councell</hi> can go contrary to the received waies of the <hi>Church</hi> in any thing: how ſhall I be able to do it, except <hi>I make ſhipwrack of my faith</hi> as <hi>S. Paul</hi> affirms <hi>Hymeneus</hi> to have don even by one fals opinion, though otherwis a Chriſtian. 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1.19. For a leſſer leak will drown a ſhip, if it be not ſtopt or pumpt out; ſo will any one errour in faith ſink a ſelf opiniating ſpirit. For in the leaſt
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:170217:86"/>we ſhall as truly reſiſt God the firſt revea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling verity as in the greateſt: and to gain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſay him in any little thing who is equally infallible in all, is no les than blaſphemy and an inſolence intolerable.

<pb n="154" facs="tcp:170217:87"/>and modeſty of the heavenly ſpous. Shee will never do it, nor no member of her body, (ſuch as by Gods grace I am) can do it without death and ruin to it ſelf. Try that will; whoſoever entertains but one particular misbeleef, he ſhall ſoon find that being therby ſeparated from the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholik body, he or his ſucceſſours will ſoon attempt another, and never lin till all be layd waſt. Beſides the <hi>Church</hi> being but a <hi>depoſitaty,</hi> or keeper of the <hi>doctrin</hi> commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to her charg, hath not power over it to exhang, diſtrain or make it away at her pleaſur, againſt the rules of honeſty. And if ſhe ſhould to content one ſort of inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vatours, chang or relent in one thing; others that would innovat in another may juſtly challeng the ſame favour, and what ſhould ſhe then have had remaining to her ſelf after ſo many innovations made by hereticks in ſo many ages? I think very little or nothing at all by this time.</p>
            </sp>
            <p>Tis worth your conſideration to ponder this. For ſo you may perceiv both the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tegrity of this <hi>immaculat ſpous</hi> in conſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving the doctrin wherwith ſhe has been in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>truſted intire and wholly ſincere: and the madnes of all <hi>ſectarys,</hi> who would each in
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:170217:87"/>their wild fanſys have the <hi>churches</hi> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliance wth them to her <hi>own ruin:</hi> and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing denied, flew out into all exorbitances againſt her, and forfeyted at once by their ſelf opinions and obſtinacy both the title of Catholik they had till then enjoyed, and the ſecurity they had in the churches bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſom. This is a worthy and profitable ſpecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation. And therfor I ſhall indeavour to ſpeak therof, wth as much order &amp; method as can well be uſed in a matter of ſuch diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>order as the confuſed heap of hereſys jum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled together may admit.</p>
            <p>THe Churches doctrine is partly about the creation and Scriptures of the old Teſtament; partly about our redemption, and things peculiar to Chriſtianity, their perſons or places, precepts or counſells, vices or vertues, Sacraments, and works, either morall, naturall or politicall; in all wch ſeverall hereticks have at times ſought to bring in innovations; wch had the church complied wthall, ſhe had had little or nothing left her by this time.

            <p>The extravagancys concerning the crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, either oppoſed the autority of cano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicall books, or judgd amiſs of the divine natur, angels and ſouls, the beginning of the world, the condition of Adam and Eve our firſt parents, Melchiſedek and the like things wch wer antecede<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t to our rede<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ption.</p>

               <hi>Carpocrates</hi> and <hi>Cerdon</hi> in the time of pope <hi>Hygin</hi> rejected all the old Teſtament; <hi>Ebion</hi> on the other ſide made the old Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t to be of equal autority wth the new, and out of the new he caſt forth al <hi>S Pauls</hi> Epiſtles as erroneous. <hi>Cerdon</hi> and <hi>Marcion</hi> diſallowed all the Goſpells beſides <hi>S.

            <p>The <hi>Gnoſticks</hi> would have two Gods, one from whence iſſue good things, the other author of evill.

The <hi>Armenians</hi> becaus God had ſaid that <hi>Cain</hi> ſhould not be ſlain by any man, would needs have him a lier, becaus <hi>Cain</hi> ſlew himſelfe. <hi>Sabellius</hi> in the time of <hi>pope Sixtus</hi> 2. would not admit any more then one perſon in God<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
               <hi>Arrius</hi> in pope <hi>Syl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veſters</hi> time oppoſed the equality of the three divine perſons. The <hi>Alogians</hi> ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged not the Son of God to be the word. The <hi>Ignoites</hi> maintained that Chriſt was ignorant of ſom things, in particular of the day of judgment. <hi>Macedonius</hi> in the time of <hi>pope Liberius</hi> made the Holy Ghoſt inferiour to the Father and Son, not of the ſame eſſence wth them, but a crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tur. <hi>Petrus Abaylardus</hi> ſaid that the Holy Ghoſt was the ſoul of the world.

            <p>The <hi>Manichees</hi> contended that the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vill
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:170217:89"/>is evill by his owne natur and not made ſo by his fall. <hi>Origen,</hi> that the devills ſhould at length be deliverd from hell. Herman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus Riſswick in the year 1512. held wth much ſtiffneſſe that neither the good An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels nor bad were created of God. The church of God reſiſted all theſe: could ſhe do otherwiſe?</p>
            <p>Others denied the creation of the ſoul imediatly by God; <hi>Seleucus</hi> affirming that it is made by Angels, of ſpirit and fire. <hi>Tertullian,</hi> that the ſoul of the Son is made by the ſoul of his Father, as his body by his body. The <hi>Gnoſticks</hi> on the other ſide, ſaid it was made of the ſubſtance of God him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf: wch was afterwards defended by the <hi>Manichees</hi> the wild ofſpring of <hi>Manes</hi> a Perſian, who affirmd himſelf to be both Chriſt &amp; the Paraclet too, &amp; ſent out his twelv Diſciples about the world to ſpread abroad his haeretical dogmes, who were much multiplied in the time of <hi>pape Foelix. Tertullian</hi> thought that the ſouls of wicked men were after death turned into devills; wch ſurely is an errour if he ſpeak of a phyſical and not of a morall turning. The <hi>Arabians</hi> on the other ſide affirmed that all ſouls quite periſh wth their body: wch
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:170217:89"/>atheiſm was alſo defended by the above named <hi>Riſſnick</hi> the Hollander.

            <p>
               <hi>Seleucus</hi> and <hi>Hermias</hi> would have the matter wherof the world was made to be coeternall wth God and not created. <hi>Foe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lix</hi> a Manichean affirmd the ſame of the Earth.

<pb n="168" facs="tcp:170217:94"/>blamed by the Catholik Prelats for ſome exceſs of devotion towards that <hi>ſacred Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin;</hi> as if they had held her a diety by ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preme adoration and incenſe; but I have forgot their names; I ſuppoſe being better adviſed by their Byſhops, they ſoon con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed themſelves to that reverence was due to ſo bleſſed an inſtrument of our wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>far, and ſo the errour was redreſt. But who ſhould dare to diſable or diminiſh either in word or deed that divine Virgin I never read of any who bore the name of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian (according to her own propheſy in Goſpell, <hi>Lo from henceforth all generations ſhall call me bleſſed</hi>) untill <hi>Helvidius</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temporary wth S. <hi>Jerom</hi> was bold to ſay, that after the birth of Chriſt ſhe accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panied <hi>S.

                  <item>IX. That the noble ſenate of Chriſtian Prelats met together in generall councells erred in their decrees and canons was the opinion firſt of <hi>Arrius,</hi> who was himſelfe condemnd in the councell of <hi>Nice;</hi> then of <hi>Neſtorius</hi> who had been cenſurd in the councell of <hi>Epheſus;</hi> then of <hi>Eutiches</hi> and <hi>Dioſcorus</hi> who had been judgd in the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell of <hi>Chalcedon;</hi> then of <hi>Huſs</hi> the Bohe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man &amp; <hi>Wicleph</hi> who was caſt in the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell of <hi>Conſtance;</hi> &amp; laſtly of <hi>Luther</hi> whoſe wicked doctrin was anathematiſd in the councell of <hi>Trent.</hi> This hereſy (if it may not rather be ſtiled blaſphemy againſt Chriſt and his church whom he promiſd to confirm in all truth) is largely confuted by <hi>Iohn Byſhop of Rocheſter, Iodocus Chlitoueus, William Ockam, Iohn Eckius,</hi> and ſeverall other Catholik doctours.</item>
                  <item>X. That all Prieſts are equall, and a By<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop is nothing above an ordinary Prieſt was the errour firſt of <hi>Aerius,</hi> then of the <hi>Waldenſes, Wicleph</hi> and <hi>Luther;</hi> condemnd by <hi>S. Auſtin</hi> in his book of hereſies, <hi>c.</hi> 53. Whether Epiſcopacy be another order or onely another degree in the ſame order, tis certain that in the old Law the chief prieſt
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:170217:97"/>or Byſhop had diſtinct veſtments, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred the <hi>Sancta ſanctorum</hi> wch others did not; and in the new Teſtament a <hi>Byſhop constitutes Prieſts,</hi> Tit. 1. not contrary; nor is any Diſciple in the <hi>Acts of the Apoſtles</hi> read to have uſed impoſition of hands, but onely the Apoſtles. And ſo the ſecond councell of <hi>Hiſpala</hi> declares that confirma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion belongs onely to the Byſhop.</item>
                  <item>XI. <hi>Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther</hi> more fondly added that all Chriſtians are equally Prieſts, forgetting that Holy Scriptur expreſly ſpeaks of ſegregating or ſetting apart ſome from the reſt to that function; <hi>I left thee at Crete that thou ſhouldſt conſtitute Prieſts,</hi> Tit. 1.</item>
                  <item>XII. The filthy fellow added that Prieſts ought not to be unmarried or ſeparated from women (wherein he exceeded <hi>Iovinian</hi> who indeed equalled marriage wth virginity, but bla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med none for remaining ſingle, himſelf liv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſo to avoid the troubles of wedlock.) This he taught the better to juſtify himſelf who being a Prieſt and a Religious man of the Hermits of <hi>S. Austin</hi> had revolting ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced a Nun. The ſame was done &amp; taught by <hi>Occolompadius</hi> who had been a monk of <hi>S. Brigit, Bucer</hi> a Dominican fryar, &amp; the reſt of Luthers retinue. Impiouſly wthout
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:170217:97"/>doubt for it was prohibited a Prieſt to mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry in the very beginning of the church by the canons of the Apoſtles, <hi>can.</hi> 27. and afterwards by the Neoceſarian councell, <hi>c.</hi> 1. decret. and it appears in ſacred Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tur it ſelf that ſuch was the practis of pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitiv times.</item>
                  <item>XIII. The Pepuſians of old promoted women not onely to the Prieſt but Prieſthood too.</item>
                  <item>XIV. All univerſitys or generall ſtudies for clargy men are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnd by Wicleph, as brought into the church by paganiſm; forgetting, that the Apoſtle exhorts <hi>Timothy</hi> a good Chriſtian to remain permanent in the things <hi>he had learnd,</hi> 2. Tim. 1. and that in the very Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles days the Chriſtians conſtituted ſchools at <hi>Antioch,</hi> Act. 14. and afterwards at <hi>Alexandria,</hi> wherin <hi>Panthenus</hi> was firſt prefect, then <hi>Clemens,</hi> then <hi>Origen.</hi> And therfor the councell of <hi>Conſtance</hi> juſtly condemnd this errour amongſt the reſt, <hi>ſeſſ.</hi> 8. againſt the 29. articl. XV. As alſo that other opinion of his, wherin he taught that ſuperiours, be they Eccleſiaſticall Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lates or Kings, may be punniſht by ſubjects at their pleaſur, by wth drawing tithes or tribut, or otherwayes, <hi>ſeſſ.</hi> 8. againſt his 27. art.

                  <item>XVI. Finally that no degree may ſcape, the <hi>Waldenſes</hi> and <hi>Luther</hi> inveighed bitterly againſt religious orders, as the invention of the devill, affirming that the founders of them were damnd for it if they repented not, and that none could be ſaved in them: wch deſperate madneſs was cenſurd alſo in the ſaid councell of Conſtance, <hi>Seſſ.</hi> 8. And ſtrongly confuted, by <hi>Chlitoveus, Roffenſis Albertus, Thomas Waldenſis</hi> a Carmelit, and before them by <hi>S. Thomas</hi> and <hi>S. Chryſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtome.</hi>
                  </item>
                  <item>XVII. To prevent all danger on any hand for any hereſy or diſorder, the <hi>Wal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denſes</hi> ſpread abroad that no judg can con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn any man to puniſhment. But they either forgat or ſimple ſouls never knew that <hi>S. Paul</hi> ſaith, <hi>if ye do evill fear; for the magistrat bears not the Sword in vain.</hi>
                  </item>
                  <item>XVIII. There were others who taught that no hereticks were to be puniſht but left to Gods judgment.</item>
                  <item>19. The <hi>Rhetorii</hi> ſaies <hi>Philaſter,</hi> affirmed that al hereticks thought aright.</item>

<pb n="177" facs="tcp:170217:98"/>called <hi>Ophitae,</hi> that they worſhipt the Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent that beguiled Eve; and the <hi>Caiani</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpected Judas for a Saint, for that he was cauſe of our redemption.</item>

            <p>Theſe be ſome extravagant opinions of ſectarys concerning ſeverall perſons in the church, kings and ſubjects, religious men, clargy men, prieſts, ſtudents, byſhops, the Senate of prelates, popes, Saints, Chriſt and what not; ſo ſenſles, ſo wild, ſo incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtent, ſo contradictory, that the wiſedom and integrity of the Church of God were not able to ſuffer, much leſſe approve them; being contrary many of them to common honeſty, others to right reaſon, all of them to Chriſtian faith.

But the <hi>councell of Florence</hi> under <hi>pope Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genius</hi> the fourth confirmd the contrary Catholik doctrin.</item>
                  <item>II. <hi>Luther</hi> afterward, allthough he held <hi>Purgatory,</hi> yet he had three errours concerning it: firſt he taught that ſouls there might themſelvs either me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit or demerit; again that a ſoul there was not certain of his ſalvation; thirdly that a ſoul ther, doth ſin ſo long as it abhors thoſe pains, and ſeeketh reſt.

                  <item>II. <hi>Eutichius</hi> Byſhop of <hi>Conſtantinople</hi> taught that the body after its reſurrection ſhould be invi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible and unpalpable. <hi>S.

                  <item>III. <hi>Origen</hi> ſaid that our bodies after reſurrection ſhould be ſtill mortall, and after many ages fall to duſt, never to riſe more. Expreſly againſt Scriptur wher tis ſaid that <hi>mortall ſhall put on imortality,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15.</item>

                  <item>II. <hi>Cerinthus</hi> would have heavenly beatitude to conſiſt in the delights of the fleſh, and that Chriſts kingdom after the reſurrection ſhould be earthly: wch errour he drew from ſome carnall Jews, being himſelf contemporary wth <hi>S. John</hi> the Apoſtle. But tis gainſayed by <hi>S. Paul, The Kingdom of God is not meat and drink but juſtice and peace and joy in the holy Ghoſt,</hi> Rom. 14. <hi>Papias</hi> Byſhop of <hi>Hierapolis</hi> did indeed teach that Chriſt after the general reſurrection ſhould raign upon earth wth his faithfull retinue, who had been ſufferers here, a thouſand
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:170217:103"/>years; drawn to that opinion by ſuch a ſpeech in <hi>Apocalips;</hi> c. 20. and after him <hi>Ir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neus, Apollinaris, Lactantius, Victorius Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctavenſis.</hi> But they held not the ſame as <hi>Cerinthus:</hi> nor were pertinacious in their opinion againſt the church, wch I think ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounds that place of the bleſſeds reign wth Chriſt according to the ſoul, from the howr of death to the generall judgment: for there tis added <hi>Haec eſt reſurrectio prima,</hi> this is the firſt reſurrection, namely of the ſoul after the bodies death.</item>
                  <item>III. <hi>Origen</hi> taught that neither miſery nor beatitude ſhould be eternall; for he conceived certain alter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations or viciſſitudes of both; ſo that the bleſſed ſouls after ſom years ſhould return to mortal bodys, and thence be called again to beatitude, in a kind of circle. But all Scripture is againſt this fanſy. <hi>Between us and you is a great Chaos, ſo that ſuch as would paſs from hence to you, cannot &amp;c.</hi> Luk. 16.</item>
                  <item>IV.

                  <item>VI. The Arme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nians taught that no ſoul is beatified before doomsday (as alſo ſome Greeks, adding that ſinners are not puniſht till that day.) This is the opinion Pope <hi>John</hi> the 22. propounded to the Univerſity of <hi>Paris.</hi> But it was gainſayed by the councel of <hi>Florence</hi> under Pope <hi>Eugenius</hi> the fourth, as contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to the churches beleef; and the Scripture it ſelf does in a manner expreſly refute it. <hi>We know if our earthly houſe of this habita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion be diſſolved, we have a hous not made by hands eternall in the heavens,</hi> 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.

                  <item>II. The <hi>Marcites,</hi> diſciples of one <hi>Marcus</hi> a magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cian, about the Apoſtles time changed the form of Baptiſm, doing it <hi>In the name of the unknown Father of all things, and in truth
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:170217:105"/>the Mother of all, and in him who deſcended upon Jeſus.</hi> For they held that God preacht in the old law was not the Father of Chriſt, becaus he was unknown. The <hi>Cataphygians</hi> and <hi>Paulianiſts</hi> alſo did not baptiſe in the name of the Trinity as Catholikes do, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to comand of Goſpell, <hi>Baptiſeing them in the name of the Father Son, and holy Ghoſt,</hi> Mat. 28.</item>
                  <item>III. The ſaid <hi>Cataphygians</hi> baptiſed the dead: They had their name from the Province of Phrygia whence they came; their leader was <hi>Montanus</hi> (who called himſelfe the <hi>Paraclet</hi>) and <hi>Priſca</hi> &amp; <hi>Maximilla</hi> his two Propheteſſes. The <hi>Marcionists</hi> did the ſame, who finding any to dye unbaptiſed they put a living man under the hers of the dead, and asked him as if he were the dead man, if he deſired to be baptiſed; anſwering yea, they baptiſed him for the dead, wch thing they ſaid <hi>S. Paul</hi> himſelf did practiſe, 1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 15. al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though <hi>Marcion</hi> their leader is not read to have don any ſuch thing: but few hereticks content themſelvs wth the errours of their leaders. <hi>Marcion</hi> himſelf was in the time of <hi>Antoninus Pius,</hi> his countrey <hi>Pontus,</hi> a great ſtoick Philoſopher, and being con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted to Chriſtian faith, he followed the
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:170217:105"/>dogmes of <hi>Cerdon,</hi> intermingling many Philoſophicall things wth his Chriſtian re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, and coming to <hi>Rome</hi> he ſeduced many Catholiks, where meeting wth S. <hi>Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lycarp,</hi> and asking him if he knew him, I know, quoth S. <hi>Polycarp, and do acknowledge the eldeſt ſon of Satan.</hi> But againſt this er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour both of the <hi>Marcionits</hi> and <hi>Cataphy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gias</hi> is the definition of the third <hi>conncell of Carthage,</hi> where tis declared that neither the Euchariſt nor baptiſm may be given to the dead.</item>
                  <item>IV. The <hi>Pſallians</hi> and <hi>Euchitae</hi> attributed no vertue at all to <hi>Baptiſm,</hi> but made all ſins to be raſed onely by Prayer: ſo likewiſe the <hi>Meſſalians</hi> and <hi>Enthuſiaſts.</hi> The <hi>Manichees</hi> alſo thought that baptiſm exhibited in water was worth nothing. The <hi>Albanenſes &amp; Albigenſes</hi> likewiſe rejected baptiſme: &amp; the <hi>Armenians</hi> took from the Sacraments all power of conferring grace. Againſt this hereſy is the decre of the <hi>coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell of Florence</hi> under <hi>Eugenius</hi> the fourth.</item>
                  <item>V. <hi>Petrus de Bruis</hi> a Frenchman of <hi>Nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bona,</hi> who was afterwards burnt in the Town of <hi>S. Giles,</hi> ſaid and taught that baptiſm was of no avail to Infants that have not the uſe of reaſon. After him one <hi>Henricus</hi> bore his Standard, from
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:170217:106"/>whom the followers of the hereſy were cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led <hi>Henricians</hi> and <hi>Bruſians.</hi> After four hundred years the Anabaptiſts raiſed up the hereſy again. But <hi>S. Denis the Areopa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gite</hi> witneſſes that children were baptiſed in the Apoſtles time <hi>c. ult. Eccl. Hier.</hi> And <hi>S. Cyprian</hi> two hundred years after, and <hi>S. Auſtin</hi> after him teſtify that it was done in their days. And the Catholik practiſe is confirmd by the councell of <hi>Lateran</hi> under Pope <hi>Innocent</hi> the third, by the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cel of <hi>Vienna</hi> under <hi>Clement</hi> the fift, and the councell of Trent under <hi>Paul</hi> the third in two Seſſions, 5. <hi>Seſſ. c.</hi> 4. 7. <hi>Seſſ. can.</hi> 19.</item>
                  <item>VI. The <hi>Donatiſts</hi> rebaptiſed ſuch as came over to their ſide: beleeving that ſuch as came to the true church was to be baptiſed again. But the firſt councell of <hi>Carthage,</hi> c. 1 <hi>decret.</hi> as alſo the councell of <hi>Vienna</hi> under <hi>Pape Clement</hi> the fifth, and the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell of <hi>Florence</hi> under <hi>Eugenius</hi> the fourth defined this opinion as erroneous. <hi>S. Cy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prian</hi> and other Byſhops of <hi>Africa</hi> held alſo, that hereticks coming to the Catholik church were to be rebaptiſed; But this they did not defend againſt the church wth per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinacy as hereticks did, but diſputed it as a probable opinion not then in their dayes
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:170217:106"/>defined, and happly upon ſuſpition that hereticks uſed not the right form and mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter. One <hi>Baltaſar</hi> a Dutchman of late held morover that all people are to be baptiſed again when they come to years of diſcre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, becaus he thought the baptiſm of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fants were of no valiew. But faith teaches there is but <hi>one Baptiſm,</hi> Eph. 4. as ther is but one death of Chriſt wch it figureth: <hi>Do ye not know that ſo many as are baptiſed unto Chriſt, are baptiſed to his death,</hi> Rom. 6.3.</item>
                  <item>VII. The <hi>Armenians</hi> taught that baptiſm ought to be conferred wth the Euchariſt; and that none can be validly baptiſed un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs he be anointed wth chriſm. <hi>Claudius Taurinenſis</hi> held baptiſm without the ſign of the croſs imprinted on the forehead to be inefficacious. Indeed the church uſes both the ſign of the croſs and criſm: wch the ancient Chriſtians would by no meanes have omitted, and the miniſter of the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments ſhould ſin in omitting thoſe or other rites of the church; yet if in caſe baptiſme ſhould be adminiſtred in the right matter and form wthout theſe, it would have its valiew; ſo the ſame church ever beleeved. And the Euchariſt though haply it might be given to ſom wth baptiſm, yet not of ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity;
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:170217:107"/>ſith baptiſm was inſtituted long be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it.</item>
                  <item>VIII. The <hi>Waldenſes</hi> on the other ſide, affirmed that baptiſm by all means ought to be received wthout mixtur of ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly oyle. The leader of theſe ſo often named Waldenſes was one <hi>Waldo</hi> of Lions in France and therfore they were ſometime called <hi>Waldenſes,</hi> ſometime <hi>Pauperes Lug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dunenſes,</hi> the ſect began about the yeare 1570. condemnd at Rome in a generall councell.</item>
                  <item>IX. That infants are not to be baptiſed was the aſſertion firſt of <hi>Pelagius,</hi> becauſe he thought they had not originall ſinne; and then of <hi>Wicleph,</hi> becauſe he thought that the faith and prayers of their parents ſufficed them. But the <hi>Milevitan councell</hi> defined that baptiſm was abſolutly neceſſary to infants ſalvation, as alſo the councell of <hi>Florence</hi> under <hi>Eugenius</hi> the fourth, &amp; the councell of <hi>Trent,</hi> Seſſ. 6. c. 4.</item>
                  <item>X. Others ther were on the other ſide, who held that a man in age and of mature judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment could no wayes poſſibly be ſaved wthout baptiſm, how much ſoever he might be contrite in heart. But the ſayd Tridentin councell under <hi>Paule</hi> the third ſilences thes alſo, <hi>Seſſ.</hi> 6. <hi>c.</hi> 4.</item>
                  <item>XI. <hi>Luther, Melanchthon</hi> and <hi>Bucer</hi> taught that baptiſm takes not
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:170217:107"/>away all ſin, becaus concupiſcence remains. But then baptiſm ſhould not be a laver of renovation, <hi>Tit.</hi> 3. Nor ſhould we by bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſme be buried wth Chriſt unto death, <hi>Rom.</hi> 6 Radical or habitual concupiſcence is no ſin at al except it be actuated by the conſent of reaſon.</item>
                  <item>XII. The <hi>Flagellantes</hi> maintained that in their time baptiſm of water had ceaſed, and baptiſm of blood ſucceeded; wch thing ſay they was ſignified in <hi>Cana of Galile,</hi> when at the end of the feaſt water was turnd into wine: And ſo they went up and down France whipping themſelves till the blood came: when they were told by their Catholik Prelats, that caſtigation of body was good, and allowa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, and practiſed even by the beſt Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, but it ought not be don wth the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judice of other parcells of faith, reveald in Goſpell; they replied that the whole Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpell at their coming had ceaſed. Theſe be the principall miſtakes I have taken notice of concerning baptiſm.</item>

This very function of <hi>Melchiſedek</hi> did Chriſt our Lord exerciſe when he offered up to God his body and blood, telling his Apoſtles preſent what he did, and what he would have done hereafter: what he did, when he ſaid, <hi>This is my body wch is given,</hi> not wch ſhal be given for you on the croſs, but wch is immolated and offerd now; <hi>This is my blood wch is ſhed.</hi> He ſhowed what he

               <p>To bring my ſpeech to a period. The <hi>Catholik Church</hi> an indulgent mother as ſhe could not but be affected to ſee children that came from her own bowells bandy and riſe up againſt her ſo tumultuouſly from time to time, ſo hath ſhe ſhowed no leſs induſtry and watchfullnes to repreſs them all; being her ſelf ſtill peremptorily reſolued not to depart whatſoever ſhould happen, ſo much as an apex or jota from the word ſhe had received. And truly her majeſty and power appears in that ſhe ſtill livs to ſee all her rebells under her feet: however through the frailty of revolting men they may grow ſtrong and multiply ſomtimes for two or three ages together, in ſome parts of the earth againſt her. I ſhall ever love and reverence this divine integrity wiſedom and power of the Catholike and immaculate ſpous of Chriſt; wch can neither tamely let fall the truths ſhe has received, nor yet by violence be forced out of her right. Indeed beſides the generall honeſty whereby ſhe ſtood obliged as a depoſitary to keep unalterable and entire all the whol tradition committed to her cuſtody; the Paradoxes of Sectaries were ſo diſſonant
<pb n="215" facs="tcp:170217:118"/>for the moſt part to right reaſon morall juſtice &amp; piety, that the wiſedome ſobriety and faith of the Church Catholik could not in any ſort comply wth them though ſhe ſhould ſink under the perſecution of Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtates. Nor had ſhe more reaſon to comply wth any one than all, according as they roſe: and ſo ſhe ſhould ever and anon gain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſay herſelf; do and undo, ſay and unſay, affirm and deny the very ſame things; for fectaries were quite contradictory to one another: Nor by this time had ſhe kept any conſiderable portion of that body of tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition ſhe received from her Redeemer wth the threat of a heavy curs on him ſhould dare to altar or diminiſh from it. Let him be accurſed that loves it, the ſpous of Chriſt is bleſſed, and ſo united wth her head that ſhe cannot depart from the truth emboweld wthin her breaſt, and as it were identified in herſelf.</p>
